abstract = {The indentation load-displacement behavior of six materials tested with a Berkovich indenter has been carefully documented to establish an improved method for determining hardness and elastic modulus from indentation load-displacement data. The materials included fused silica, soda–lime glass, and single crystals of aluminum, tungsten, quartz, and sapphire. It is shown that the load–displacement curves during unloading in these materials are not linear, even in the initial stages, thereby suggesting that the flat punch approximation used so often in the analysis of unloading data is not entirely adequate. An analysis technique is presented that accounts for the curvature in the unloading data and provides a physically justifiable procedure for determining the depth which should be used in conjunction with the indenter shape function to establish the contact area at peak load. The hardnesses and elastic moduli of the six materials are computed using the analysis procedure and compared with values determined by independent means to assess the accuracy of the method. The results show that with good technique, moduli can be measured to within 5{\%}.},

abstract = {Due to its excellent mechanical properties and stable chemical behaviours, the diamond-like carbon (DLC) coating has been extensively used as a low-frictional and wear-resistant protective coating in MEMS. However, its efficacy on resisting nanofretting damage of silicon substrate needs to be verified. With an atomic force microscopy, the nanofretting behaviours of ultrathin DLC coating and its Si(100) substrate against SiO2 microsphere were investigated under vacuum and air conditions. The applied normal load Fn was 2$\mu$N and the displacement amplitudes ranged from 0.5nm to 100nm. The experimental results indicated that the DLC coating revealed a strong effect on the nanofretting regime, adhesion force, friction force and nanofretting damage of Si(100)/SiO2 pairs. Either in vacuum or in air condition, the coating could expand the slip regime of Si(100)/SiO2 pairs into a lower value of displacement amplitude. Owing to the absence of oxygen and water molecule in vacuum, both the adhesion and friction forces on DLC coating were similar as those on Si(100) substrate. However, while the nanofretting ran in air, the DLC coating could significantly reduce the adhesion and friction forces of Si(100) substrate. Even though the coating was only 2nm in thickness, it could effectively protect the silicon substrate from nanofretting damage. In vacuum, the ultrathin DLC coating can prevent the formation of hillock on Si(100) substrate. In air, the wear depth on DLC coating was {\textless}5{\%} of that on Si(100) substrate under the same nanofretting conditions. These results can help us to develop the surface engineering technology to minimize the nanofretting damage of silicon contact surfaces in MEMS. {\textcopyright} 2011 Elsevier B.V.},

@article{Jenei2018,
abstract = {{\textcopyright} 2018 IOP Publishing Ltd. Incomplete fuel burning inside an internal combustion engine results in the creation of soot in the form of nanoparticles. Some of these soot nanoparticles (SNP) become adsorbed into the lubricating oil film present on the cylinder walls, which adversely affects the tribological performance of the lubricant. In order to better understand the mechanisms underlying the wear caused by SNPs, it is important to understand the behavior of SNPs and to characterize potential changes in their mechanical properties (e.g. hardness) caused by (or during) mechanical stress. In this study, the behavior of individual SNPs originating from diesel engines was studied under compression. The experiments were performed in a transmission electron microscope using a nanoindentation device. The nanoparticles exhibited elasto-plastic behavior in response to consecutive compression cycles. From the experimental data, the Young's modulus and hardness of the SNPs were calculated. The Young's modulus and hardness of the nanoparticles increased with the number of compression cycles. Using an electron energy loss spectroscopy technique, it was shown that the sp 2 /sp 3 ratio within the compressed nanoparticle decreases, which is suggested to be the cause of the increase in elasticity and hardness. In order to corroborate the experimental findings, molecular dynamics simulations of a model SNP were performed. The SNP model was constructed using carbon and hydrogen atoms with morphology and composition comparable to those observed in the experiment. The model SNP was subjected to repeated compressions between two virtual rigid walls. During the simulation, the nanoparticle exhibited elasto-plastic behavior like that in the experiments. The results of the simulations confirm that the increase in the elastic modulus and hardness is associated with a decrease in the sp 2 /sp 3 ratio.},

abstract = {The stress/strain behavior of bulk material is usually investigated in uniaxial tension or compression; however, these methods are not generally available for very small volumes of material. Submicrometer indentation using a spherical indenter has the potential for filling this gap with, possibly, access to hardness and elastic modulus profiles, representative stress/strain curves, and the strain hardening index. The proposed techniques are based on principles well established in hardness testing using spherical indenters, but not previously applied to depth-sensing instruments capable of measurements on a submicrometer scale. These approaches are now adapted to the analysis of data obtained by stepwise indentation with partial unloading, a technique that facilitates separation of the elastic and plastic components of indentation at each step and is able to take account of the usually ignored phenomena of ''piling up'' and ''sinking in''.},

@article{Fairbanks1987,
abstract = {The oxidation resistance of turbine airfoils was enhanced by the use of diffused aluminides beginning in the mid-1950s; these coatings are still extensively used today. In the late 1960s, research began on developing overlay coatings which formed thin protective CrO2, SiO2or Al2O3scales on the coating surface. The Al2O3scale forming coatings systems or MCrAlY coatings can operate at higher temperatures than other systems and can protect turbine airfoils for engines used in electric power generation, naval surface ship and aircraft propulsion, particularly in commercial and transport service. Most engine manufacturers agree that the best near-term candidate for major engine performance improvement would be to develop successfully thermal barrier coatings for turbine airfoil applications. Thermal barrier coatings could allow up to a 149°C (300°F) increase in turbine inlet temperature without a penalty in service life. Alternatively, at current operating conditions they could significantly extend engine hot-section life by reducing the airfoil operating temperature and eliminating hot-streaking problems. Diesel engines are the most fuel-efficient production heat engines yet devised. This level of performance has been achieved with very modest use of advanced materials. Thus, as far as performance improvements are dependent on materials, the diesel engine holds an exciting potential. The largest diesel performance gains in a decade have been achieved with turbocharging advancements. The major gains for the next decade appear to be in the low heat rejection engine concept, generally referred to as the "adiabatic diesel concept". The major efficiency advances obtainable with the adiabatic diesel concept result from converting the increased exhaust gas energy into work. The most viable energy extraction method is to install another turbine in the exhaust that is mechanically connected to the engine output shaft. This is termed "turbocompounding". The greatest improvement comes from a bottoming cycle. The problems of low heat rejection diesel engine waste heat utilization are cost, complexity and durability. {\textcopyright} 1987.},

@article{Szolwinski1996,
abstract = {Fretting is a contact damage process arising from surface microslip associated with small-scale oscillatory motion of clamped structural members. The fretting damage process is a synergistic competition among wear, corrosive and fatigue phenomena driven by both the microslip at the contact surface and cyclic fretting contact stresses. Fretting fatigue is one mechanism of the formation of cracks in many common structural members, often leading to multi-site damage in riveted lap joint assemblies in aging aircraft. Thus a criterion for prediction of fretting fatigue crack nucleation is needed, A detailed analysis of the microslip distribution at the contact surface and the subsurface stress field is required for such a prediction. Relevant closed-form solutions for the 2-D elastic stress fields are adapted for reduced loading configurations modeled in a recently constructed fretting fatigue experiment that applies loads relevant to aircraft lap joints. The resulting stress field is combined with a multiaxial fatigue theory that combines strain-life ideas with a maximum normal stress to predict both the initiation site and life of fretting fatigue cracks. In particular, the theory predicts formation at the trailing edge of contact - not the location of the maximum shear stress traditionally associated with crack formation in contact fatigue. The fretting fatigue crack nucleation theory is validated through comparison with data in the literature. Once validated, the model is used to investigate the effects of coefficient of friction, load intensity and fatigue properties on life. It is shown that increases in coefficient of friction and surface microslip sharply reduce the number of cycles required to nucleate cracks. Application of the fretting fatigue crack nucleation model to actual loading configurations in common structural members such as riveted lap joints can lead to a tool for evaluating fatigue life of those members.},

The mechanical properties of the DLC coating and its steel substrate were determined via nano-indentations and a FEM supported evaluation of the obtained results. The coating fatigue and adhesion were quantified by perpendicular and inclined impact tests respectively, coupled with appropriate finite element method (FEM) calculations. The inclined impact tests were conducted under lubricated conditions for avoiding abrasion caused by sliding friction on the coated surfaces. In this way, the coating fatigue failure during this test was mainly affected by the impact load, the material's properties and the film adhesion. The effects of these factors on the coating fatigue failure were described via an iterative FEM supported method. Using this method, the coating adhesion was estimated taking into account the exercised impact loads and the determined material properties.},

Ti–6Al–4Fe $\alpha$+$\beta$ titanium alloy is also tested for comparison. Experiments were carried out at open circuit potential and at a passive applied potential using a pin-on-flat reciprocating sliding tribo-electrochemical apparatus. The potential, anodic current and friction coefficient were measured in situ as a function of time. The $\beta$ alloys exhibited a tendency to repassivate during sliding at passive and open circuit potential. The predominant wear mechanism of the metal-polyethylene pairs was 3 body wear, exhibited by the transfer of polyethylene to all titanium alloys. Polyethylene showed a comparatively low wear against $\beta$ titanium alloys. The effect of the addition of synovial fluid constituents, namely bovine serum albumin, hyaluronic acid and dipalmitoyphosphatidylcholine on the tribocorrosion of Ti–29Nb–13Ta–4.6Zr alloy was also studied. The presence of additives affected the friction coefficient, induced an increase of the wear volume, and a modification of the dominant wear mechanism which was identified as abrasion without transfer of polyethylene.},

abstract = {The micromachining technology that emerged in the late 1980s can provide micron-sized sensors and actuators. These micro transducers are able to be integrated with signal conditioning and processing circuitry to form micro-electromechanical-systems (MEMS) that can perform real-time distributed control. This capability opens up a new territory for flow control research. On the other hand, surface effects dominate the fluid flowing through these miniature mechanical devices because of the large surface-to-volume ratio in micron-scale configurations. We need to reexamine the surface forces in the momentum equation. Owing to their smallness, gas flows experience large Knudsen numbers, and therefore boundary conditions need to be modified. Besides being an enabling technology, MEMS also provide many challenges for fundamental flow-science research.},

abstract = {This paper reviews the available literature relating to the emerging research into the performance of coatings under combined wear and corrosion conditions. Understanding how coatings perform under these tribo-corrosion conditions is essential if the service life of equipment is to be predicted and to allow service life to be extended. Therefore, the tribo-corrosion performance of coatings deposited by a variety of techniques is discussed and the main mechanisms associated with their degradation under combined wear and corrosion highlighted. Coating composition, microstructure, defect level, adhesion, cohesion and substrate properties are seen as some of the critical elements in coating performance when subjected to tribo-corrosion contacts. The importance of post-coating deposition treatments such as laser resurfacing and sealing are also discussed. Interactions between wear and corrosion mechanisms are identified along with some models and mapping techniques that aim to inform coating selection and predict performance. Recent investigations into mono-layer as well as multilayered and functionally graded coatings are reviewed as candidates for wear–corrosion resistant surfaces. The review reveals the need for a more considered approach to tribo-corrosion testing and the way in which the results are analysed and presented. For example, the test conditions should be appropriate to the coating system under test; the level of in situ instrumentation deployed and the post-test analysis of in situ electrochemical data should be carefully selected as well as details given of the composition of any surface tribofilms formed and the identification of the degradation mechanisms.

abstract = {Stainless steel, CoCrMo alloy and titanium alloy are the most commonly used metal materials for artificial joint. But the generation of wear debris and metal ions limits the use of the metal, especially for the metal-on-metal type artificial joint. Diamond like carbon (DLC) coating can reduce the wear and corrosion of these metal alloys. But the service behavior of the DLC coating on different metal substrates may be different. This paper studied the difference of the structure, adhesion, wear and corrosion properties of the DLC coating on different substrates (stainless steel, CoCrMo or titanium alloy). The results show that the structure of the DLC coating on these substrates is similar. The DLC coating on titanium alloy shows the best adhesion than that on stainless steel and CoCrMo alloy, because the chemical bond energy holding Ti atom (of titanium alloy surface) and C atom (of DLC) together is the strongest. The failure mode of DLC coatings on 316L stainless steel and CoCrMo alloy in the friction test is coating delamination. The DLC coating on Ti6Al4V alloy shows the best wear resistance due to its good adhesion. Immersion and electrochemical tests show that the DLC coating on Ti6Al4V substrate has better stability than that on 316L stainless steel and CoCrMo alloy because the Ti6Al4V substrate can prevent the corrosion more efficiently than 316L stainless steel and CoCrMo alloy. In the case of no interlayer, Ti6Al4V alloy is the most feasible metal joint material for DLC modification with good adhesion, wear and corrosion resistance compared with 316L stainless steel and CoCrMo alloy.},

abstract = {Hard thin films are often employed as protective coatings for metal substrates and their fatigue/fracture property (especially that under contact) needs to be sufficiently understood. In this study, we present a combined experimental/computational framework for exploring the fracture characteristics of hard thin films upon both monotonic and cyclic contacts. The techniques of acoustic emission and corrosion potential fluctuation are combined to monitor the mode and initiation of crack, and numerical simulations based on the finite element method provide further information on the criterion of film fracture. For a model system of a TiN film physical vapor deposited onto a stainless steel substrate, ring cracks are produced when the stress in the film exceeds critical - such a critical moment arrives when the substrate undergoes excessive deformation, which makes the curvature of film bending critical just outside the contact zone. Since cyclic contact loading encourages large plastic deformation of substrate due to ratcheting plasticity, it is found that the critical contact force degrades, compared with monotonic loading. The present experimental/computational methodology is useful for obtaining the information of film fracture property under both monotonic and cyclic contact loads. {\textcopyright} 2009 Elsevier B.V.

abstract = {The prediction and monitoring of erosion and erosion-corrosion attack on oil and gas pipeline materials in service is useful for facilities design, material selection and maintenance planning so as to predict material performance accurately, operate safely, and prevent unplanned production outages. Conventional methods such as failure records, visual inspection, weight-loss coupon analysis, can be time-consuming and can only determine erosion or erosion-corrosion rates when the damage has already occurred. To improve on this, the acoustic emission (AE) technique combined with electrochemical monitoring was chosen and implemented in this study to investigate and characterise erosion and erosion-corrosion degradation rates of oil and gas pipeline materials (X65) under Submerged Impinging Jet (SIJ) systems in a saturated CO2 environment. Measured acoustic emission energy was correlated with the mass loss from gravimetric measurement for different flow velocities and sand loadings. Sand particle impacts were quantified and compared with theoretical predictions, and the associated impact energies predicted from Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) were correlated with measured acoustic emission energy and mass loss. The combined acoustic emission and electrochemical monitoring (involving Linear Polarisation Resistance (LPR) and Electrochemical Impedance spectroscopy (EIS)) helped to simultaneously investigate the surface reactivity of the corroding materials as well as capture the sand impacts contribution during the erosion-corrosion degradation processes. Results reveal that the effect of the mechanical damage which is not sensed by in-situ electrochemical measurement is adequately captured by the AE method, thus making the combined technique a novel approach for in-situ monitoring of both the electrochemical and mechanical damage contributions of erosion-corrosion degradation processes.},

abstract = {Diamond-like carbon (DLC) films combine several excellent properties like high hardness, low friction coefficients and chemical inertness. The DLC coating material can be further classified in two main groups, the hydrogenated amorphous carbon (a-C:H, ta-C:H) and the hydrogen free amorphous carbon (a-C, ta-C). By adding other elements like metals (a-C:H:Me) or non-metal elements like silicon, oxygen, fluorine or others (a-C:H:X), several modifications of the properties can be adjusted according to application requirements. First reports on hard amorphous carbon films were published in the 1950s and about 20. years later there began worldwide intensive research activities on DLC. In the following years the number of publications increased continuously and the importance for industrial applications became more and more evident. Several deposition techniques were applied to prepare a-C:H, ta-C, metal containing a-C:H:Me and non-metal containing a-C:H:X coatings. In parallel the structure and deposition mechanisms of DLC coatings were extensively studied. An essential obstacle for a broad industrial application was the high compressive stress level in a-C:H films causing delamination and limiting the film thicknesses. With metal based intermediate layer systems most adhesion problems could be solved satisfactorily and thus from the mid-1990s the pre-conditions for a broad application especially in the automotive industry were given. With modified a-C:H:X and a-C:X coatings a considerable friction reduction or surface energy adjustments could be achieved. {\textcopyright} 2014 Elsevier B.V.},

DLC on titanium (Ti) is very interesting for industrial applications (e.g. biomedical applications), while also an excellent model system for the general understanding of hard and brittle films on ductile metallic substrates. Interlayers deposited between the DLC film and the Ti substrate have been shown to affect failure of such DLC coated Ti substrates. In this study, the effect of interlayer structure on contact damage and cohesive and adhesive failure is studied with tantalum (Ta) in its $\alpha$- and $\beta$-phase. In all investigated cases the more ductile $\alpha$-Ta provides improved results over the hard and brittle $\beta$-Ta interlayer. Due to plastic deformation effects, the resistance to contact damage is significantly increased with an $\alpha$-Ta interlayer. Delamination occurs at the interface between the Ti substrate and the Ta interlayer. Compared to DLC on Ti without a Ta interlayer no enhancement in onset strain of fragmentation and delamination was achieved. A finite-element analysis shows that stress concentrations can be distributed over both interfaces if the Young's modulus of the interlayer material is of the order of the Young's modulus of the DLC.},

The threshold amplitude of slip at which fretting damage becomes apparent is found to be in the region of 0.5 $\mu$m. Very low amplitudes of slip and low frequencies (0.001 Hz) are particularly damaging in electrical contacts, leading to high resistances resulting from oxide build-up. In high temperature fretting, oxide formation can give protection. In titanium alloys this can be improved by ion implantation, particularly with bismuth. In aqueous solutions, such as sea water, fretting stimulates the chemical dissolution of material, which accounts by far for the major part of the wear. {\textcopyright} 1984.},

abstract = {The effect of substrate surface roughness on the wear behaviour of diamond-like carbon (DLC) coatings deposited on M42 tool steel substrate with composite interlayers has been investigated on a ball-on-disk wear rig in dry air. After deposition, the surface roughness of the coating was approximately half of the original substrate surface roughness. While the frictional behaviour was not apparently affected, the wear rate of the coatings increased significantly with increase in the substrate surface roughness. Wear rate increased rapidly when the substrate surface roughness exceeded R(a) 0.93 $\mu$m. Above this substrate roughness, the dominant wear mechanism also changed from adhesion to chip/flake formation and fragmentation of the coatings. Chipping/flaking of the coatings initially occurred mainly at the tops of asperities of the surface texture. The Archard specific wear rate increased with increase in total load for coatings on the rough substrate surfaces; however, this was almost invariant with increase in load for coatings on the smoother substrate surfaces, nominally following the Archard's wear law. Contact pressure distributions over the real area of contact between the ball and the rough coating surfaces have been analysed by applying the elastic foundation model of contact mechanics. It has been shown that the contact pressures increase significantly with increase in surface roughness of the coatings. Plastic yielding is highly possible in the coatings deposited on rough substrate surfaces above R(a) 0.93 $\mu$m. The observed apparent effect of surface roughness on wear and wear mechanism transitions of the DLC coatings can be explained according to the contact mechanics analysis results.

Hysteresis loops are replicated by using a Bouc-Wen modified formulation, which includes wear to simulate the evolution of contact parameters and to model the evolving dynamic behaviour of the rig. A comparison of the measured and predicted dynamic behaviour demonstrates the feasibility of the proposed approach and highlights the need to consider wear to accurately capture the dynamic response of a system with frictional joints over its lifetime.},

abstract = {In the present work, the tribological mechanism of diamond-like carbon (DLC) films was investigated. DLC films were coated on metallic substrates (M50 steel, Ti-6Al-4V alloy and AISI 440C steel) by methane ion-beam deposition, Pin-on-disc experiments showed that the DLC films possess excellent wear resistance and exhibit low values of friction coefficient (fc0.1). The frictional response was characterized by an initial break-in period that was followed by an intermediate constant f stage. The presence of a carbon transfer layer was observed on the wear scars of ball surfaces. Transmission electron microscopy and electron diffraction from the transfer layer showed that it contained a fine distribution of graphite nanoparticles (less than 5 nm) in a distorted diamond-like structure. Laser Raman spectra taken from the wear track region also revealed evidence of graphitization. In light of the present observations, the intermediate friction stage was mainly attributed to transfer layer formation. During long-duration wear experiments, a further reduction infwas observed that finally reached steady state low friction (f=O.O5-0.07) and an ultra-low wear rate (about 1.6 x lo-' mm3 m-l N-l). Ste a y s a e d t t was related to the complete transformation of diamond-like to graphite-like carbon under thermal and strain effects from the repeated friction through a precursor stage involving hydrogen evolution and sp3 structure destabilization. The ultra-low wear rates were correlated to easy shear of low-strength atomic carbon interlayers in the graphitic structure.},

abstract = {The paper analyses some fretting fatigue results from the literature, reported by Nowell and by Szolwinski and Farris. The principal variables of contact size, peak pressure, remote specimen tension, and tangential force ratio are identified and these are used to construct an Artificial Neural Network (ANN), aimed at predicting total fretting fatigue life. The network is trained and validated using 90{\%} of the data, and its success at predicting the results for the remaining 10{\%} of unseen data is examined. The network is found to be very effective at separating the results into low life and ‘run-out' groups. It is less successful at predicting lives for the low life specimens, but this is largely due to the difficulty of incorporating the runout and finite life tests together in the same dataset. The approach is seen to be potentially useful and identifies contact size as a key variable. However, the results highlight the need for significant numbers of experimental results if the method is to be used effectively in future. Nevertheless, the trained network comprises a useful tool for the prediction of future experimental results with this material.},

Boundary lubrication properties of DLC films with metals are improved as comparing with DLC films without metal under lubricant with both MoDTC and ZDDP additives. Moreover, lower friction coefficient of $\mu$=0.03 than carburized steel is exhibited with the appropriate quantity of Ti added. The tribochemical reactant was formed on the sliding surface of the Ti-containing DLC film like as carburized steel.

abstract = {One of the most significant applications of the impact test is to investigate thin hard coatings fatigue properties. Herein the test conditions and duration up to the film damage initiation, are considered in order to determine the critical stresses associated with the coating fatigue strength. Moreover, the subsequent film damage propagation is a significant mechanism as well, since it refers to the ability of the coating to withstand loads after its fatigue damage initiation. In order to describe the film fracture propagation the failed area ratio was introduced and an algorithm to determine this magnitude developed, based on the analysis of imprint scanning electron microscopy graphs. The application of the coating failed area ratio will be demonstrated in various impact test film cases, also with superficial thin layers. The top layers do not affect, in general, the failure initiation of the basic coating. However, according to the obtained results, the superficial films influence the basic coating failure propagation rate during the impact test. {\textcopyright} 2004 Elsevier B.V.

It has been used to study the small scale wear of Si(100) using a 4.6$\mu$m spheroconical indenter as test probe over the applied load range 30–300mN. Contact damage assessment by in situ measurements of probe displacement were supplemented by post-test SEM imaging and wear scar analysis by confocal microscopy. The wear behaviour was dependent on the rate of initial loading. When the load was applied abruptly ({\textless}0.3s), radial and lateral cracking and material removal was observed and large displacement jumps (pop-ins) were observed during the subsequent 1000s constant load nano-fretting test. The crack morphology was very similar to that in repetitive nano-impact tests and conventional nanoindentation at higher applied load with the same probe. In contrast, when the load was applied more slowly (10s) radial cracking was not observed and there was a distinct threshold load (∼100mN) marking the transition to a more severe wear mode with extensive lateral cracking and material removal.},

At lower load the coating mechanical properties and microstructure are beneficial in providing improved impact resistance.

abstract = {There is an increasing usage of PVD-coated hardmetals in applications where contact loads of cyclic nature between curved surfaces are common, e.g. cold forming tools and machine components. Thus, knowledge of both the mechanical response and the damage mechanisms involved during contact fatigue of these systems is required if they want to be used effectively. In this investigation this is approached by implementing spherical indentation testing techniques. Experimental work includes the evaluation of monotonic indentation stress-strain curves, cyclic indentation stress-number of cycles diagrams and subsurface damage evolution. Emphasis is placed on determining the indentation stress affiliated to the emergence of circular cracks at the coating, event here proposed and proved to be the critical failure stage for the columnar TiN film and the low cobalt/fine grained WC-Co hardmetal substrate under study. It is found that the coated system investigated is susceptible to contact fatigue. However, the corresponding fatigue sensitivity, assessed on the basis of an indentation stress analysis of the relative contact response under monotonic and cyclic conditions, is rather low. Such a result is rationalized by considering the ceramic nature as well as the high residual compressive stress state of the hard coating, the system component where the damage defined as critical takes place. {\textcopyright} 2008 Elsevier Ltd.

abstract = {This paper presents an experimental study of the fretting crack nucleation threshold, expressed in terms of loading conditions, with a cylinder/plane contact. The studied material is a damage tolerant aluminium alloy widely used in the aerospace application. Since in industrial problems, the surface quality is often variable, the impact of a unidirectional roughness is investigated via varying the roughness of the counter body in the fretting experiments. As expected, experimental results show a large effect of the contact roughness on the crack nucleation conditions. Rationalisation of the crack nucleation boundary independently of the studied roughnesses was successfully obtained by introducing the concept of effective contact area. This does show that the fretting crack nucleation of the studied material can be efficiently described by the local effective loadings inside the contact. Analytical prediction of the crack nucleation is presented with the Smith-Watson-Topper (SWT) parameter and size effect is also studied and discussed. {\textcopyright} 2004 Elsevier Ltd.

The elastic stiffness constants of the alloys are calculated using the special quasirandom structure method. For multilayers with sharp interfaces we prove the applicability of a linear-elasticity approximation and show that it can be used with success instead of performing direct computationally demanding ab initio calculations. We explore the trends and the potential of multicomponent alloying in engineering the strength and ductility of both, quaternary alloys and their multilayers. We investigate X(1−x−y)TixAlyN alloys where X is Zr, Hf, V, Nb or Ta, and present an analysis based on increasing x. We show that with increasing Ti content ductility can increase in each alloy. Elastic isotropy is observed only in (Zr,Hf,V)(1−x−y)TixAlyN alloys in the middle of the compositional triangle, otherwise a high Young's modulus is observed along [001]. We predict that coherent TiN/X(1−x−y)TixAlyN and ZrN/X(1−x−y)TixAlyN alloy multilayers with the [111] interfacial direction show increasing ductility with increasing x, while the multilayers with the [001] orientation become more brittle.

Not only are their mechanical properties interesting, electrically the diamond-like amorphous carbon films are also easier to dope than crystalline diamond, making them potentially a better alternative to amorphous silicon for photovoltaic devices. We will show that electron energy loss spectroscopy, in particular the carbon 1s core absorption spectroscopy, has been instrumental in revealing the nature of the bonding between carbon atoms.

abstract = {Stress and strain modelling and stress field computer simulations are today an important tool for systematic approach and optimisation of tribologically stressed coated contacts. Modelling illustrates and quantifies the dominating parameters resulting in crack initiation, crack growth and failure of coated surfaces. Friction and its components, adhesive and ploughing friction, are necessary input parameters in stress modelling. In Finite Element Method (FEM) modelling the ploughing component is integrated in the model while the adhesive component needs to be determined as input value for stress simulations. This paper presents how adhesive friction is determined for the TiN ($\mu$a = 0.066) and DLC ($\mu$a = 0.047) coatings from experimental friction measurements. The experimental value is used as an input value in the three dimensional finite element micro-model that simulates the spherical tip sliding on a DLC coated flat substrate with increasing load similar to the conventional scratch test contact. Based on the numerical contact analysis (FEM) similar friction evolution compared to the experimental friction in scratch testing was depicted. However, the analytical approach resulted in a diverse solution. {\textcopyright} 2007 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

@article{Fouvry2003,
abstract = {To quantify wear rates, the Archard approach is classically applied. It relates the wear volume to the product of the sliding distance and the normal load. A wear coefficient is then extrapolated and is supposed to establish the wear resistance of the studied material. This synthesis shows that this approach does not work when the friction coefficient is not constant. It appears to be much more relevant to consider the interfacial shear work as a significant wear parameter. This approach is applied to study the wear response of different steels and then extended to different hard TiN, TiC coatings under reciprocating sliding conditions. By identifying wear energy coefficients the wear quantification can be rationalized and the wear resistance of the studied tribosystems can be classified. This also appears to be a convenient approach to interpret the different wear mechanisms. Metallic materials involving plastic strain are analyzed from FEM computations. The energy balance confirms that a minor part of the dissipated energy is consumed by plasticity, whereas the major part participates in the heat and debris flow through the interface. When a load energy approach is introduced an accumulated density of the dissipated energy variable is considered to quantify the tribologically transformed structure (TTS) formation. A wear "scenario" of metallic structures is then discussed. This energy wear approach is applied to analyze hard coating wear mechanisms focusing on abrasion and oxidation phenomena. The local wear energy analysis is transposed, thus allowing the lifetime of hard coatings to be quantified. {\textcopyright} 2003 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.},

@article{Blok1955,
abstract = {The load-carrying or power-transmitting capacity of many machine parts is decisively affected by the maximum temperatures that occur in the source of .frictional heat. In controlling these temperatures, and thus the performance limits concerned, two types of dissipation of frictional heat, which act in series, have to be accounted for: 1. Primary heat-dissipation, which may be defined as "short distance" dissipation within the source of frictional heat and in its immediate vicinity. a, In boundary lubrication the heat source is constituted by the area of contact and so the "solid-frictional" heat is primarily conducted away into the rubbing bodies where they approach closest. b. In hydrodynamic lubrication the heat source is constituted by the fluid film and hence the primary dissipation of "viscous-shearing" heat takes place from point to point within the film, and from the film to its bounding surfaces, i.e. into the rubbing bodies, 2. Secondary heat-dissipation, which may be defined as "long-distance" dissipation of frictional heat from its' source towards some cooling surface, which, by emitting heat towards its surroundings, prevents undue accumu- lation of heat in the machine part as a whole. Secondary heat-dissipation is not typical of rubbing surfaces: in principle it does not differ from that in machines embodying heat-sources not created by frictional heat. The factors entering into the various problems pertaining to the two types of heat-dissipation are discussed particularly as to their effect upon the maximum temperatures attained on rubbing surfaces, Attention is drawn first of all to the primary heat-dissipation, not only because it is often much more crucial than the secondary heat-dissipation, but also because, notwithstanding primary heat-dissipation is most typical of rubbing surfaces, it is the least known of the two types.},

By controlling the nature, content and distribution of the dopants, tailored synthesis of doped-DLC with properties adapted to a desired value for specific applications can be obtained. Common dopants are light elements (B, Si, N, O or F), metals and combinations thereof to modify properties such as hardness, tribological properties, internal stress, adhesion, electrical conductivity or biocompatibility. The purpose of this chapter is to provide an overview of the different alloyed-DLC and more novel nanostructured coatings reported in the literature in relation with the property of interest. The tribological properties will be discussed in light of their chemical composition and microstructure trying to obtain general trends or correlation between them when possible due to the high number of parameters influencing their practical tribological response.},

In order to distinguish unequivocally between films prepared with different density, thickness, and RTA treatment, a new method for analysis of Raman spectra was invented. This newly developed analysis method consisted of plotting the position of the Raman G band of carbon versus its full width at half maximum. Moreover, we studied the passivation of non-radiative recombination centers during RTA by performing measurements of the increase in photoluminescence in conjunction with the analysis of DLC:H networks simulated by molecular dynamics. The results show that dangling bond passivation is primarily a consequence of thermally-induced sp2 clustering rather than hydrogen diffusion in the film.},

Information from on-line mechanical analysis and from off-line material behaviour analysis is used to present an explanation of the damage processes. The degradation of the TiN coating is dominated by the development of an oxidation reaction. Under certain conditions the amorphous structure of the DLC will undergo partial graphitization.

abstract = {Two kinds of ultrathin dual-layer films, which contain both bonded and mobile phases in ionic liquids layer, were fabricated on silicon substrates by a two-step process. As an anchor layer, (3-aminopropyl)triethoxylsilane (APS) and N-[3-(trimethoxylsilyl)propyl]ethylenediamine (DA) separately self-assembled on silicon surfaces, then a few ionic liquids molecules were chemically bonded to the silicon substrates modified by the self-assembled monolayers (SAMs) to form two-phase structure. The formation and surface properties of the films were analyzed by means of ellipsometric thickness measurement, water contact angle measurement, attenuated total reflection Fourier transform infrared (ATR-FTIR) spectrometry, multi-functional X-ray photoelectron spectra (XPS), and atomic force microscope (AFM), It is shown that DA form more densely packed films than APS, and the density of the amino-terminated underlayer largely affects the density of the subsequent bonded ionic liquids layer. The adhesive and nanotribological behaviors of the films were evaluated by a homemade colloidal probe. A ball-on-plate tribometer was used to test the microtribological performances of the films. As a result, the two kinds of dual-layer films show the improved tribological properties than the single-layer ionic liquids film deposited directly on the silicon surface, which is ascribed to synergic effect between flowable mobile phase and steady bonded phase. In particular, the dual-layer film containing DA-SAM possesses excellent micro/nanotribological properties characterized by lower friction and higher antiwear ability due to more densely packed bonded phase and a few mobile phases. By studying the influences of self-assembled underlayer on tribological properties of ultrathin dual-layer film, we might find the way to further improve tribological properties and acquire insights into their potential in resolving the tribological problems of micro-electromechanical systems (MEMS). {\textcopyright} 2010 Elsevier B.V.},

The coatings on the details and test samples are applied simultaneously: in a single batch processing.},

abstract = {Currently, the application of diamond-like carbon (DLC) coatings for automotive components is becoming a favorable strategy to cope with the new challenges faced by the automotive industry. DLC coatings can effectively lower the coefficient of friction (CoF) and wear rate of engine components, consequently improving the fuel efficiency and durability of these components. Commercially available fully formulated lubricating oils enhance the lubrication of ferrous materials. Therefore, the interaction between nonferrous coatings (e.g., DLC) and commercial lubricating oil must be investigated. A ball-on-plate tribotester was used to run the experiments using stainless steel plates coated with amorphous hydrogenated DLC (a-C:H) and tetrahedral DLC (ta-C) sliding against a 440C stainless steel ball. Wear track was investigated by scanning electron microscopy and atomic force microscopy. Energy dispersive spectroscopy and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy were used to analyze the tribofilms inside the wear track. Raman analysis was performed to investigate the structural change of the coatings. At high temperatures, the CoF decreases but the wear rate increases in the a-C:H and ta-C DLC-coated plates. CoF and wear rate (coated layer and counter surface) are mostly influenced by coating graphitization. Tribochemical films, such as polyphosphate glass, are formed in ta-C and act as protective layers. Therefore, the wear rate of ta-C DLC is lower than that of a-C:H DLC. {\textcopyright} 2014 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract = {In this work, the tribological behaviour of DLC-coated as well as uncoated tools was characterized by tests on a tribometer. Special attention was paid to assess how the failure mechanisms of the films proceed, for example, whether the so-called "eggshell effect" plays a role in the failure of the films. Compared to the uncoated tools, the DLC-coated tools showed a significantly lower friction coefficient to the work piece material stainless steel X5CrNi18-10. As the contact pressure was varied from 215 to 330 N/mm2, which is comparable to the maximum contact pressure in deep drawing, no damages in form of cracks or flaking were observed. Furthermore, lubricant-free micro deep drawing was performed with DLC-coated tools made of tool steel X153CrMoV12. Though no lubricant was used, the experimentally measured punch force was lower than that from experiments using lubricant with uncoated tools. This indicates that the DLC-coating has a great application potential in micro forming. {\textcopyright} 2011 Published by Elsevier B.V.},

abstract = {To increase the wear resistance property of a Ti alloy, a plasma electrolytic oxidation (PEO) process was used to form protective oxide coatings. The present work was mainly to study the effects of pure sliding and impact-sliding combined forces on failure behaviours of the oxide coatings with different thicknesses (10-27 ??m). A recently-developed impact-sliding test method was used to investigate the combined force effects on the coatings and the uncoated substrate for comparison. In each impact-sliding cycle, the forces comprised a dynamic impact load, Fi, and a pressing load, Fp. The combined loadings were pre-set to be (Fi = 80, 130, 200 N and Fpmax = 200, 300, 400 N, respectively) applied by a steel ball (SI 52100). The test results show that the rough top layers of PEO coatings can cause early failure of the coatings and a large mass-loss on the counterface steel balls. For a relatively smooth coating without polishing, the porous structure can help to cushion the impact force comparing to the exposed dense inner layers of the thick coatings that were ground to have a similar surface finish. Incorporation of Si and P elements into the Ti oxide coatings may alter the surface affinity behaviour and stoichiometry of Ti oxides, causing different wear behaviours under impact and sliding forces. ?? 2013 Elsevier B.V.

@article{Beake2004a,
abstract = {A repetitive contact technique, nano-impact testing, has been used to investigate the fracture properties of tetrahedral amorphous carbon (ta-C) thin films deposited on silicon by the filtered cathodic vacuum arc method. The impact test has shown clear differences in the resistance to impact wear of ta-C films with their thickness, for film thicknesses between 5 and 80 nm. The resistance to impact-induced fracture decreases as the film thickness increases. This may be due to the maximum shear stress being closer to the film-substrate interface, or reflect reduced toughness in the thicker films that are less able to deform as the substrate deforms plastically during the repetitive contact test. The mechanism of impact-induced failure on these thin films is (i) the initial impact stage where plastic deformation causes cracks to nucleate sub-surface, (ii) fatigue-further nucleation and growth of sub-surface cracks (with little or no change in probe depth) and (iii) crack coalescence and film fracture leading to a rapid change in probe depth as the film fails. The influence of impact load on fracture probability has been investigated. Fracture probability increases sharply as the impact load is increased from 100 to 300 $\mu$N. The greater load provides the stresses necessary to nucleate and propagate the sub-surface cracks; at low load the driving force for the cracks to coalesce and spall the coating is much reduced, so failure is less likely to occur within the test duration. {\textcopyright} 2003 Elsevier B.V.

abstract = {Diamond-like carbon (DLC) coatings have became accepted non-ferrous coatings for automotive tribo-components as they offer excellent tribological properties resulting in improved fuel economy and reduced dependence on existing lubricant additives which can be harmful to catalytic converters and ultimately to the environment. Obtaining optimum durability (wear) as well as high fuel economy (low friction) using DLC-coated parts relies in part on the compatibility between surface and lubricant additives. The objective of this study is to understand the role of friction modifiers and antiwear additives on the durability of DLC coating under boundary lubrication conditions. Experiments were performed using a pin-on-plate tribotester using plates coated by 30 at.{\%} hydrogen containing DLC (HDLC) sliding against cast iron (CI) pins. The physical observation of the wear scar, formed on the HDLC coating by low friction and/or antiwear additives, was performed using both optical and scanning electron microscopes. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy analysis was performed on the tribofilms to help to understand the tribochemical interactions between oil additives and the HDLC coating. Based on the physical observations and tribochemical analysis of the wear scar, the mechanisms of failure/wear of the HDLC coating are proposed and the requirement for designing optimal additive packages for the HDLC coating is discussed. ?? 2008 Elsevier B.V.

Different positive voltage amplitudes (100, 200, 300, 400 and 500 V) were used to evaluate the effect of this operation mode on the discharge process and the mechanical properties of the deposited DLC coatings. The application of positive pulses was observed to enhance the ionization of both the sputtered carbon and argon species. Mass spectroscopy measurements showed that a larger amount of high-energy C + ions are generated, with ion energies proportional to the amplitude of the overshoot voltage. The ion bombardment induced by the positive pulses led to higher compressive residual stresses and densification of deposited DLC coatings. Moreover, their Raman spectra exhibited lower D-band and G-band intensity ratios (I D /I G ) as the pulses voltage was increased which is indicative of higher sp 3 content. Mechanical properties were evaluated by nanoindentation testing and the hardness of the deposited DLC films was observed to increase from 9.6 GPa (for no voltage pulse applied) to 22.5 GPa (for an applied positive pulse voltage of 500 V).},

Careful examination of Sneddon's solution for indentation by a rigid cone reveals several largely ignored features that have important implications for nanoindentation property measurement. Finite element and analytical results are presented that show corrections to Sneddon's equations are needed if accurate results are to be obtained. Without the corrections, the equations underestimate the load and contact stiffness in a manner that leads to errors in the measured hardness and modulus, with the magnitudes of the errors depending on the angle of the indenter and Poisson's ratio of the half-space. First order corrections are derived, and general implications for the interpretation of nanoindentation data are discussed.},

The range of physical, chemical, mechanical, electrical, and optical properties offered by these films is also exceptional and can meet the increasingly multifunctional application needs of machine elements, microelectronics, and biological systems. Since the early 1990s, carbon has been used as a precursor in our laboratory for the design and synthesis of superhard and low-friction carbon films. As a result of systematic studies over the years, in 1997, we developed a new class of DLC films that provide friction and wear coefficients of 0.001-0.005 and 10-10-10-9 mm3/N m, respectively, in inert-gas or vacuum test environments. This paper will mainly concentrate on the tribology of these superlow-friction carbon films and provide an update on our understanding of the fundamental tribological mechanisms of such films. It will also expand on the effects of hydrogen within the films and gaseous species within the test environments on friction and wear. {\textcopyright} 2004 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

abstract = {This study investigates the effect of discrete spot laser surface hardening (LSH) on austempered ductile iron (ADI) specimens. ADI surfaces were irradiated with single laser pulses, having different beam powers and diameters with the intent of establishing the parameters that yield a surface with the best combination of maximum hardness and hardened depth, whilst exhibiting minimal distortion and no cracking. A process parameter map was plotted and showed that to produce a hardened microstructure without melting and cracking, one must operate within a very small range of parameters achieving surface hardness values between 700 and 800 HV and depths of approximately 150 $\mu$m. The resulting microstructure consisted of martensite with unaltered graphite nodules. After laser hardening, the mean surface roughness increased from 0.15 to 0.43 $\mu$m. When applying laser powers higher than 780 W, melting was observed within the laser spot. Laser surface melting (LSM) resulted in a severely distorted surface, with an increase in the mean surface roughness from 0.15 to 1.34 $\mu$m. Within the melted zone, transverse cracks and the dissolution of the graphite nodules could be observed. The rapid self-quenching associated with laser melting resulted in an austenitic microstructure having a surface hardness of approximately 400 HV. A martensitic structure with hardness values peaking around 700–800 HV, was observed at a depth 250–300 $\mu$m below the molten structure.},

This type of device failure is one of the dominant sources of yield loss in MEMS. This paper reviews the physical mechanisms responsible for the failure from both the theoretical and practical stand point. In general, the failure requires two different phenomena. First (a) The device must be subject to a force sufficiently strong to collapse the elastic member thus bringing it in contact with the substrate. (b) After contact is established and the force removed, the intersolid adhesion must exceed the elastic member restoring force hence keeping the device permanently pinned to the substrate. Both of these problems develop during the device fabrication as well as during the device operation. Normalized elastic member dimension bounds for prevention of collapse and pinning are presented. The failure rate can also be reduced using a wide variety of processing, surface treatment, and physical schemes. These are discussed in regard to their practical applicability},

Fretting tests are conducted with a ball contacting with a flat disc in air. The specimens used are a bearing steel for a ball, and a bearing steel or an aluminum alloy for a flat disc. The results show that the behavior of the AE output and the dissipation energy during each fretting cycle is not so similar to each other throughout the test, but the total AE root-mean-square and the total dissipated energy during the test have a good correlation between them. {\textcopyright} 2008 Elsevier Ltd.

abstract = {Material wear due to erosion-corrosion in slurry transport equipment is prevalent in process industries such as the oilsands industry. Damage to equipment can cost a typical oilsands industry nearly {\pounds}200 million annually, along with an associated health and safety risk to man and environment [6]. New materials are continuously developed in order to endure wear under adverse erosion-corrosion conditions better and laboratory testing offers a good option to test new materials prior to commission. Traditionally the performance of a set of new materials are assessed based on their overall wear behavior in a laboratory test and is ranked accordingly, with the best performing material generally used for application. However, due to differences in prevailing conditions on the material surface and geometrical variations between actual and test geometry, accurately correlating data from a laboratory test to field scenario can be highly complex. Also the ranking system is not capable of predicting wear profiles for specific conditions and hence a new wear prediction method was developed and is presented in this thesis. This method has been developed, using a combination of standard laboratory based experiments and Computational Fluid Dynamic (CFD) simulations. As a starting point only wear due to erosion is considered and this thesis provides validation of such an approach. The method involves two stages in which (i) a universal wear map is generated for the material and abrasive combination in question using a standard laboratory test Uet impingement test) to generate a wear scar on a simple geometry. The local wear rate from this is interpreted using a CFD simulation of the test to generate a map giving local wear as a function of particle impact velocity and angle; (ii) a CFD solution is calculated for a series of different erosion configurations giving the particle impact data at each point on the surface. The wear map from the first stage is then used to give the local wear rate. The power of this method is that once a material-specific map has been generated then wear on any geometry can be calculated through the simulation of flow using CFD. As validation of this, wear on a typical plant geometry (1.50 90 0 elbow bend) is undertaken and the general applicability of this method is demonstrated.},

Nanoindentations on film surfaces, at various pressures micro-blasted, revealed the influence of the different micro-blasting grains on the coating superficial hardness. For investigating the effect of the developed film compressive stresses at certain micro-blasting pressures and grain qualities on the film's brittleness, nano-impact tests were conducted. Moreover, roughness and cutting edge geometry measurements were carried out via confocal microscopy and EDX microanalyses after micro-blasting by Al2O3 or ZrO2 grains for detecting potential film thickness decrease and substrate revelation. The wear behaviour of coated and variously micro-blasted tools was investigated in milling of hardened steel.

abstract = {In the present work, we systematically investigate the tribocorrosion behaviour of diamond-like carbon (DLC) films on 316L stainless steel substrates in the context of their biomedical applications. Two different bond layers at the interface were particularly studied, namely the plasma nitrided layer and the plasma deposited amorphous hydrogenated silicon nitride (a-SiNx:H). Tribocorrosion tests were performed using a ball-on-flat tribometer where the sliding contact is fully immersed in NaCl 1 wt.{\%} solution. The sample was connected to a potentiostat: it served as a working electrode and its open circuit potential (OCP) was monitored before, during, and after sliding. Electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) was applied to characterize the electrochemical behaviour of the surfaces before and after rubbing. The OCP measured during sliding was shown to depend on the properties of the protective layer; a decrease in the OCP indicates delamination of the protective layer and subsequent exposure of the substrate to the electrolyte. We found that the DLC coating with the nitrided bond layer delaminated from the wear track within 50 cycles of sliding, while it resisted the entire tribocorrosion test (1800 cycles) without failure when the a-SiNx:H bond layer was applied. The EIS results are interpreted in terms of appropriate equivalent circuits. It is shown that the a-SiNx:H bond layer significantly increases the corrosion resistance by acting as a corrosion barrier, while the DLC coating assures high wear resistance and low friction. The polarization resistance of DLC-coated 316L with the a-SiNx:H bond layer was found to be 3.76 G$\Omega$ cm2compared to 27.5 M$\Omega$ cm2for the same DLC coating without a-SiNx:H. {\textcopyright} 2009 Elsevier B.V.

abstract = {Use of low friction non-ferrous coatings for engine tribo-components exposed to boundary lubrication is becoming popular in automotive industries. The excellent tribological behaviour of some non-ferrous coatings also reduces dependence on some harmful components of lubricants. In this work, hydrogenated diamond like carbon (HDLC) and chromium nitride (CrN) coatings sliding against cast iron counterbody have been used to study the interaction with friction modifiers (Moly dimer and Moly trimer) and antiwear additive zinc dialkyldithiophosphate (ZDDP) under boundary lubrication condition. The tribological results of the non-ferrous coatings are compared with those of uncoated steel. Tribofilms are formed using a reciprocating pin-on-plate tribometer. The chemical analysis of the tribofilms has been accomplished using X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS). The XPS analysis shows that the friction modifiers form a low friction tribofilm on the non-ferrous coatings. No antiwear tribofilm derived from ZDDP was observed on the HDLC coating but a stable antiwear tribofilm was found on the CrN coating. Moly dimer together with ZDDP+Base Oil showed the lowest friction coefficient for the CrN coating while Moly trimer along with ZDDP+Base Oil gave the lowest friction for the HDLC coating. This study will investigate the generic differences between the tribofilms formed on the DLC and CrN coatings by two additive-containing oils. {\textcopyright} 2007 Elsevier Ltd.

abstract = {Nanoindentation is now commonly used for the study of mechanical properties of materials on the nanoscale. One of the significant improvements in nanoindentation testing is the continuous stiffness measurement (CSM) technique. It offers a direct measure of dynamic contact stiffness during the loading portion of an indentation test and, being somewhat insensitive to thermal drift, allows an accurate observation of small volume deformation. Nanoscale damage caused by fatigue is of critical importance to the reliability of ultrathin protective overcoats and micro/nanostructures. The cyclic loading used in the CSM makes the technique useful for the evaluation of nanofatigue. Methodologies of the CSM technique used for the characterization of layered materials and nonhomogeneous composites are reviewed and discussed. Applications of the CSM technique to the measurement of contact stiffness, elastic modulus, hardness, creep resistance, and fatigue properties of the materials used in magnetic storage devices are presented. The nanoindentation CSM technique, in conjunction with nanoscratch and friction and wear tests, can be satisfactorily used for the materials characterization of magnetic storage and microelectromechanical systems (MEMS) devices and should find more application. {\textcopyright} 2002 Elsevier Science Inc.

For the w-ZrAlN/c-ZrN multilayer, there is no coherency between sublayers leading to strain relaxation during annealing causing the hardness to drop. The retained coherency between layers and the compressive strain in the w-ZrAlN/c-TiN multilayer results in superior fracture toughness compared to the w-ZrAlN/c-ZrN multilayer as revealed by cross-sectional investigations of damage events under scratch and indentation tests.},

Unfortunately, the bond concept is incomplete and fails to explain more subtle aspects of molecular and materials behavior. A rich set of examples is provided by attempts to identify the structural origins of nonzero Cauchy pressures, a quantity that has been said to reflect the nature of the bonding at the atomic level. We show that these deviations are easily explained by extending the concept of a bond from a linkage between atoms to a set of linkages between charge density critical points (maxima, minima, and saddle points). Further, we show that these links possess an identifiable structure with measurable characteristics. For the nonmagnetic bcc transition metals, we are able to write the Cauchy pressure as a function of these characteristic measures. Significantly, the model should be generalizable to other structures and will provide insight into the relationships between the charge density and elastic response.},

With the development of low-emission and low-consumption engines, diamond-like carbon (DLC) coatings have been considered as promising surface coatings of engine parts in terms of friction and wear performance. However, the performance of DLC-coated parts depends on the compatibility and interaction between the coating and lubricant additives. To obtain high-performance coatings in the engine environment, the tribological behaviors of non-doped and metal-doped carbon-based coatings (a-C and a-C/WC, respectively) were studied systematically in poly-alpha-olefin (PAO) oil at 180 °C (operating temperature of engine oil) with and without antiwear additive zinc dialkyldithiophosphate (ZDDP) under various applied loads. Energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy, Raman spectroscopy, and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy were performed on a friction surface to understand tribological mechanisms. Results showed that ZDDP-derived tribofilms were able to suppress the surface graphitization of carbon-based coatings. The combination of ZDDP-derived tribofilms and tribochemical products WS 2 /WO 2 , which formed under the joint actions of heat and contract pressure, led to improved tribological behavior of a-C/WC coating in PAO with ZDDP additive.},

Basic equations and parameters employed to calculate hardness are clearly explained, and the different international standards for each method are summarized. The limits for each scale are explored, and the different forms to calculate hardness in each method are compared and established. The influence of elasticity and plasticity of the material in each measurement method is reviewed, and the impact of the surface deformation around the indenter on hardness values is examined. The difficulties for practical conversions of hardness values measured by different methods are explained. Finally, main issues in the hardness interpretation at different scales are carefully discussed, like the influence of grain size in polycrystalline materials, indentation size effects at micro- and nanoscale, and the effect of the substrate when calculating thin films hardness. The paper improves the understanding of what hardness means and what hardness measurements imply at different scales.},

abstract = {Diamond-like carbon (DLC) coatings are recognized in many sectors as a promising way of controlling wear and the corrosion performance of components. DLC coatings are well established in the automotive industry where they are applied to the moving parts of direct injection fuel systems operating under frictional conditions at high pressures and in the aggressive environment of the combustion chamber. Over the last few years, there have also been an increasing number of reports of DLC coating applications in oil and gas production contexts, including in pipes, shut-off gates and various types of valves. This paper reviews current efforts to use DLC coatings in the oil and gas sectors and analyses typical coating degradation mechanisms including wear and wear-accelerated corrosion regimes. DLC coating deposition techniques including Physical (PVD) and Chemical Vapor Deposition (CVD) techniques are elaborated and the unique coating properties obtained from those two methods are assessed. Surface functionalization is discussed including dopants (W and Si) and gradient interlayers. Finally, the outlook for future use of DLC coatings in oil and gas production is discussed.},

abstract = {Abstract The application of diamond like carbon (DLC) coatings in tribological applications, the range of deposition methods employed and techniques for characterising the structure and properties of the films produced are reviewed. Thus far, DLC coatings have found broad industrial application, particularly in optical and electronic areas. In tribological applications, DLC coatings are used successfully as coatings for ball bearings where they decrease the friction coefficient between the ball and race; in shaving applications where they increase the life of razor blades in wet shaving applications; and increasingly in automotive applications such as racing engines and standard production vehicles. The structure and mechanical properties of DLC coatings are dependent on the deposition method and the incorporation of additional elements such as nitrogen, hydrogen, silicon and metal dopants. These additional elements control the hardness of the resultant film, the level of residual stress and the tribological properties. As DLC films increasingly become adopted for use in industry, knowledge of the factors that control their properties, and thus the ultimate performance of coated components in practical tribological applications, becomes increasingly important. The current state of tribological research on DLC is reviewed.},

abstract = {The effect of substrate and surface roughness on the contact fracture of diamond-like carbon coatings on brittle soda-lime glass substrates has been investigated. The average surface roughness (Ra) of the examined samples ranged from 15 nm to 571 nm. Contact damage was simulated by means of spherical nanoindentation, and fracture was subsequently assessed by focused ion beam microscopy. It was found that, in the absence of sub-surface damage in the substrate, fracture occurs in the coating in the form of radial, and ring/cone cracks during loading, and lateral cracks during unloading. Increasing the surface roughness results in a decrease in the critical load for crack initiation during loading, and in the suppression of fracture modes during unloading from high loads. When sub-surface damage (lateral cracks) is present in the substrate, severe spalling takes place during loading, causing a large discontinuity in the load-displacement curve. The results have implications concerning the design of damage-tolerant coated systems consisting of a brittle film on a brittle substrate. {\textcopyright} 2010 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract = {A novel micro-scale repetitive impact test has been developed to assess the fracture resistance of hard coatings under dynamic high strain rate loading. It is capable of significantly higher impact energies than in the nano-impact test. It retains the intrinsic depth-sensing capability of the nano-impact test enabling the progression of the damage process to be monitored throughout the test, combined with the opportunity to use indenters of less sharp geometry and still cause rapid coating failure. The micro-impact test has been used to study the resistance to impact fatigue of Al-rich PVD nitride coatings on cemented carbide. The impact fatigue mechanism has been investigated in nano- and micro-scale impact tests. Coating response was highly load-dependent. A Ti0.25Al0.65Cr0.1N coating with high H3/E2 performed best in the nano- and micro- impact tests although it was not the hardest coating studied. The role of mechanical properties, microstructure and thickness on impact behaviour and performance in cutting tests is discussed.},

Based on a general structure of the law of friction, we propose a generalized master curve procedure for elastomer friction where the significant governing parameter – indentation depth (or normal force) was taken into account. Unlike the generation of the classical master curve by horizontal shifting of dependence “friction - logarithm of velocity” for different temperatures, in the case of various indentation depth the shifting in both horizontal and vertical direction is required. We experimentally investigated coefficient of friction of elastomer on sliding velocity for different indentation depths and temperatures, and generated a ‘master curve' according to this hypothesis.},

In this study the potential for using the synchrotron-based reflection mode X-ray absorption spectroscopy (XAS) technique for in-situ chemical characterisation of lubricant films has been studied. Thermal films formed from zinc dialkyl dithio phosphate (ZDDP) and molybdenum dialkyl dithio carbamate (MoDTC) lubricant additives have been formed and analysed in-situ using the X-ray absorption near edge structure (XANES) spectroscopy technique. The surface sensitivity of this approach was improved by doing the analysis in reflection mode, enabling analysis of only top layer (up to around 10 nm) of the solid surface. In addition, in-lubro analysis of pre-formed tribofilms from the same additives was done using non-vacuum conditions. The results are discussed in conjunction with XANES and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) analysis of similar additives published in the literature. The results obtained are consistent with the existing ZDDP and MoDTC literature and provide some new insight into intermediate species not reported before. The advantages and disadvantages of the developed XANES methodology for in-situ surface chemical analysis of lubricated conditions are discussed. {\textcopyright} 2014 Elsevier B.V.

The onset of “plastic” behavior during loading and hysteresis during unloading was readily observed at loads in excess of 70 mN. Cracking about the residual impression was observed only at loads of 350 mN and higher. An analysis of the data is presented that estimates the following: (1) the initial onset of deformation occurs at a mean pressure of 11.8 ± 0.6 GPa, (2) the mean pressure at higher loads is 11.3 ± 1.3 GPa, and (3) the hysteretic transition on unloading occurs at mean pressures between 7.5 and 9.1 GPa. These values are in good agreement with the accepted literature values for the known silicon transformation pressures.

This concept has particular relevance to Tribology, and since its development in the early twentieth century, it has been applied to develop important models of plastic flow, sliding friction, rheology, wear, and tribochemistry. This paper reviews the development of stress-augmented thermal activation and its application to all of these areas of Tribology. The strengths and limitations of the approach are then discussed and future directions considered. From the scientific point of view, the concept of stress-augmented thermal activation is important since it enables the development of models that describe macroscale tribological performance, such as friction coefficient or tribofilm formation, in terms of the structure and behaviour of individual atoms and molecules. This both helps us understand these processes at a fundamental level and also provides tools for the informed design of lubricants and surfaces.},

A special emphasis has been directed towards crack nucleation and early growth during Stage I and Stage I-to-Stage II transition, Stage II crack growth. Photoelastic experiments especially showed that crack propagation under fretting-fatigue loading was strongly dependent upon the complex cyclic micro-sliding behaviour of the crack faces.

abstract = {Surface nanocrystallization (SNC) can markedly improve surface mechanical properties of metallic materials and accelerate thermal diffusion of elemental atoms. In this work SNC is used as a pretreatment method to improve mechanical properties of the DLC coating on the 304 stainless steel. Surface mechanical attrition treatment (SMAT) was used to generate a nanocrystalline surface layer on the steel substrate. Then the DLC coating with Cr adhesive interlayer was sputter deposited on the coarse-grained and the surface nanocrystallized steel substrates (noted as CG-DLC, SNC-DLC samples, respectively). X-ray diffraction confirms an amorphous nature of the carbon coating. Elemental analysis by energy dispersive X-ray reveals the enhancement of Cr diffusion into the steel substrate for the SNC-DLC sample. The microhardness, scratch, Rockwell-C indentation, cyclic impact and wear tests show that the SNC-DLC sample has higher surface hardness and load-bearing capacity than the CG-DLC sample. The mechanical tests also evidence that the SNC-DLC sample possesses higher film cohesion strength and better wear resistance as compared to the CG-DLC sample. Mechanisms for the enhancement of cohesion and adhesion strength of the DLC coating on SNC stainless steel substrate are discussed. This work may provide an advantageous hybrid processing for improving surface mechanical properties of austenitic stainless steel and other relatively soft structural steels compared with the conventional duplex treatment consisting of thermal-chemical processes (nitriding, carburizing, etc.) and hard coatings. {\textcopyright} 2012 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract = {This overview article on diamond-like carbon (DLC) coatings in medical applications covers the interaction of cells and tissue with DLC and alloyed DLC to generate desired cell reactions as well as the release of toxic elements. The promising in vitro results of DLC to prevent thrombus formation in vascular applications are summarized and the problems of transferring these results to in vivo applications are described. Since DLC shows extremely low wear in technical applications, a desired implementation is also to build wear particle free, articulating joint replacements by coating the bearing surfaces. Several in vivo studies using DLC coatings on articulating joints resulted in a failure due to partial coating delamination some years after implantation. It will be shown that this delayed delamination was caused by crevice corrosion (CC) of the adhesion-promoting interlayer and the reason why different corrosion processes may prevent an easy transfer of a successful technical application of DLC onto an implant will be discussed. The main issue for successful, long-term, in vivo applications of DLC coatings on implants is to predict the in vivo survival time and especially the long-term adhesion stability of the coating. The formation at the interface of a few atomic layers of reaction products, usually a metal-carbide, will be addressed. Furthermore, any contamination from residual gas or any cross contamination will result in a different reactively formed interface material with different properties. Delamination can then occur by a slowly advancing crack in this thin carbidic layer governed by the laws of stress corrosion cracking (SCC). It will be shown that if a stable coating adhesion is obtained, DLC coated articulating implants show basically no wear of the coating up to 101. million articulations on a simulator corresponding to about 101. years of in vivo articulation. {\textcopyright} 2013 Elsevier B.V.},

The nature of the G and D vibration modes in graphite is analyzed in terms of the resonant excitation of pi states and the long-range polarizability of pi bonding. Visible Raman data on disordered, amorphous, and diamondlike carbon are classified in a three-stage model to show the factors that control the position, intensity, and widths of the G and D peaks. It is shown that the visible Raman spectra depend formally on the configu- ration of the sp2 sites in sp2-bonded clusters. In cases where the sp2 clustering is controlled by the sp3 fraction, such as in as-deposited tetrahedral amorphous carbon (ta-C) or hydrogenated amorphous carbon (a-C:H) films, the visible Raman parameters can be used to derive the sp3 fraction.},

abstract = {Carbon is one of the most remarkable elements among all others in the periodic table. It exists in more than 90{\%} of all known chemical substances and has the largest number of allotropes. Carbon-based solid materials exhibit exceptional properties such as super-high hardness and thermal conductivity, like in diamond, or unusual softness and lubricity, like in graphite. Besides these, carbon is the building block of carbon-based allotropes including white carbon (or ceraphite), nanotubes, buckyballs, other fullerenes, carbon-carbon composites, glassy c arbons, and carbon nanofibers. During the last three decades or so, carbon has also been the key element in the synthesis of thin coatings of diamond, diamond-like carbon (DLC), carbon nitride, boron carbide, and a myriad of transition metal carbide, and carbo-nitride coatings. Because of their exceptional mechanical and tribological properties, these coatings are now used in a wide range of engineering applications to control friction and wear. Figure 1 is a ternary diagram (proposed by Robertson and Ferrari) that illustrates the specific domains of various carbon-based coatings with respect to their sp2- and sp3-type bonding characteristics and hydrogen contents. A more comprehensive overview of these and other DLC films is provided by Robertson in Chapter 1. The fullerene-type allotropes of carbon represent a new class of materials and their usefulness is being explored in novel nano- to microscale devices. The family of DLC coatings is perhaps the largest and represents one of moststudied among all other coatings. These coatings were first discovered in the early 1950s by Schmellenmeier [1] but did not attract much attention until the work of Eisenberg and Chabot almost two decades later [2] . During the 1980s, a few more researchers developed interest in these films, while during the 1990s, the research on DLC films gained momentum [3,4]. As can be deduced from Figs 2-4, almost Figure presented. every year since the early 1990s, numerous papers and patents have been devoted to DLC films. Since 2000, these films have attracted even more interest, and they are still the subject of numerous scientific studies. In the following sections, we will provide a brief overview of recent developments in the field of DLC films, in general, and some of the major milestones, in particular. We will also summarize the current status and future trends in these films. More comprehensive overviews of DLC films are provided in Section A of this book. In this section, Chapter 1 reviews various forms and compositions of DLC films, while Chapter 2 tackles the challenging subject of characterization. These films are metastable forms of carbon combining both sp2 and sp3 hybridizations, including hydrogen when a hydrocarbon precursor is used during deposition. These two chapters do not deal with tribology, but understanding the tribological behavior of DLC films requires a solid background on the chemical and structural nature of these films, which, in turn, depends on the deposition process and/or parameters. The chemical Figure presented composition, such as the hydrogen and/or nitrogen content or the presence of other alloying elements, controls the mechanical and tribological properties of a sliding pair consisting of DLC on one or both sliding surfaces. Among the many properties of an engineering material, hardness and stiffness play the most important roles in its ability to carry the load and, hence, in its wear resistance. Chapter 3 reviews the mechanical properties of DLC films extending from organic polymers for highly hydrogenated DLC films to diamonds for tetrahedral unhydrogenated DLC films. Whatever the nature of the DLC, one should keep in mind that the industrial success of DLC films in tribological contacts is strongly dependent on their adhesion properties. Basically, DLC films adhere well on substrates containing elements forming carbides, such as silicon or titanium. In most cases, intermediate layers need to be deposited in situ on the substrate before the deposition of the DLC films. This practice is detailed in the chapters of this book dedicated to industrial applications. Nevertheless, one of the most critical aspects of DLC films is the presence of stress, mainly resulting from the quenching of the impinging species during film growth. Chapter 4 reviews the various mechanisms responsible for stress in DLC films. {\textcopyright} 2008 Springer Science + Business Media, LLC.},

@article{Harding1994,
abstract = {Results of an investigation aimed at developing a technique by which the fracture toughness of a thin film or small volume can be determined in nanoindentation experiments are reported. The method is based on the radial cracking which occurs when brittle materials are deformed by a sharp indenter such as a Vickers or Berkovich diamond. In microindentation experiments, the lengths of radial cracks have been found to correlate reasonably well with fracture toughness, and a simple semi-empirical method has been developed to compute the toughness from the crack lengths. However, a problem is encountered in extending this method into the nanoindentation regime with the standard Berkovich indenter in that there are well defined loads, called cracking thresholds, below which indentation cracking does not occur in most brittle materials. We have recently found that the problems imposed by the cracking threshold can be largely overcome by using an indenter with the geometry of the corner of a cube. For the cube-corner indenter, cracking thresholds in most brittle materials are as small as 1 mN (∼ 0.1 grams). In addition, the simple, well-developed relationship between toughness and crack length used for the Vickers indenter in the microindentation regime can be used for the cube-corner indenter in the nanoindentation regime provided a different empirical constant is used.},

abstract = {Fretting regime transition is traditionally achieved by qualitative assessment of the fretting loops (tangential force, Q vs tangential displacement $\delta$) and material response. Other studies used parameters in which thresholds are theoretically determined to exceed friction at the contact for regime transition identification. This study successfully developed a flexible loop analysis method based on simple vector principles that is able to quantify and characterise its constituent parts. In terms of fretting contact analysis the loop analysis method provided a complementary method of regime transition identification to those based on theoretically overcoming friction at the contact, with strong agreement between the two. This novel method provides an efficient way to correlate regime transition with other data sets, with additional insights into the mechanical response of the contact compared to other regime transition criteria. Possible applications of this method include enabling smart asset monitoring and in the development of engineering components that are subject to fretting. This is an extremely flexible technique that has applicability for other types of loop analysis.},

Quantitative understanding of surface chemical reactions in real operating environments is challenging due to resolution and environmental limitations of existing techniques. Here we report an atomic force microscope technique that can measure reaction kinetics driven at the nanoscale by multiphysical stimuli in an ambient environment. We demonstrate the technique by measuring local reduction of graphene oxide as a function of both temperature and force at the sliding contact. Kinetic parameters measured with this technique reveal alternative reaction pathways of graphene oxide reduction previously unexplored with bulk processing techniques. This technique can be extended to understand and precisely tailor the nanoscale surface chemistry of any two-dimensional material in response to a wide range of external, multiphysical stimuli.},

@article{Liskiewicz2003,
abstract = {Fretting is considered as a specific type of reciprocating sliding. It is defined as a small displacement amplitude oscillatory motion between two solids in contact, usually induced by vibrations. Depending on the loading conditions (displacement amplitude, normal loading), fretting causes damage by surface fatigue and wear induced by debris formation. To prevent such damage, numerous hard coatings have been developed which improve the wear resistance of contacts. However, one difficulty is to estimate how long it will be before the coating wears through. Studies have been conducted to analyze the effect of displacement amplitude normal force or ambient atmosphere, but usually under constant loading conditions. Such a situation is far from real operating components, where elements are subjected to variable loadings implying variable displacement amplitudes. To predict the durability of a coating under variable fretting displacements, wear depth is quantified as a function of the maximum accumulated dissipated energy density by derivation from a global energy wear approach. This model is compared to TiC vs. alumna fretting experiments. Very good correlation is observed between the prediction and the wear depth, independently of the applied variable amplitude sequences. An equivalent 'Miner-Energy' wear model is introduced which permits the durability of the coating to be estimated. {\textcopyright} 2002 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.},

abstract = {The determination of the sliding transition is of primary importance in describing the loading conditions in a contact. Various damages have been observed depending on the sliding regime. Assuming Mindlin hypotheses, an analysis for an elastic ball on flat contact submitted to a constant normal force and a varying tangential force is made. Both the energy and the sliding ratio are studied in order to quantify the fretting behaviour. They present a theoretical constant at the transition but their experimental determination is dependent on the tangential accommodation of the testing apparatus. Nevertheless, by combining the two former variables it is possible to deduce a system free criterion. This analysis is completed by considering the discontinuity of the transition through differential calculations. Finally an expression of the boundary between the partial and gross slip is given to describe the transition in fretting maps (RCFM). These theoretical results are compared with experiments obtained for two different tribo-systems HSS-Cr-steel and HSS-TiN (5$\mu$m)-Cr-steel and various loading conditions. Good correlation is observed between theoretical and experimental results if the tangential accommodation of the apparatus is taken into account. {\textcopyright} 1995 Elsevier Science S.A.

abstract = {When sand is present in carbon dioxide (CO2) corrosion environments in oil and gas pipe flow, wear rates of carbon steel pipelines can be severe. The wear mechanism when surfaces are exposed to impact by a particle-laden fluid is known as erosion-corrosion and consists of erosion and corrosion components, with degradation enhanced by interactions between the mechanisms. A lack of understanding of erosion-corrosion of carbon steel and the mechanisms contributing to enhanced degradation through erosion and corrosion interactions exists. Erosion-corrosion of carbon steel in CO2 conditions was the subject of investigation in this work to gain further insight into erosion-corrosion and the interactions between erosion and corrosion. Erosion-corrosion investigations were completed in a range of conditions using different flow geometries. The influence of flow velocity, temperature, corrosion inhibitor, flow geometry and sand concentration on erosion-corrosion degradation of X65 carbon steel, a common pipeline grade steel, was investigated. A submerged impinging jet (SIJ) was used to complete a case study to understand how significant erosion-corrosion degradation of X65 was in field conditions. High degradation rates were measured in high velocity, sand-laden flows and corrosion inhibitors added to the solution to protect the X65 surface did reduce corrosion rates, but did not reduce erosion effects, resulting in high degradation rates. An investigation into the mechanisms of erosion-corrosion interactions revealed that work-hardened layers were thick and more refined on samples subject to erosion conditions compared with samples used in erosion-corrosion tests. This was explained by removal of the work-hardened layers, formed after particle impacts, through electrochemical dissolution, resulting in corrosion-enhanced erosion. Erosion-enhanced corrosion was shown not to be significant in the conditions tested. Flow geometry was also shown to have a significant influence on the erosion-corrosion degradation rates. A 90° elbow was designed to evaluate erosion-corrosion in pipe flow conditions that showed small erosion contributions to erosion-corrosion degradation on the outer radius of the elbow. To fully understand erosion-corrosion conditions in both flow geometries, computational fluid dynamics (CFD) was used to predict mass transfer coefficients and sand particle trajectories in the flow. Predictions were used to define the erosion mechanisms in the different geometries and to explain why degradation rates could vary significantly between different flow geometries.},

Here, we test the small molecule flexible ligand docking program Glide on a set of 19 non-$\alpha$-helical peptides and systematically improve pose prediction accuracy by enhancing Glide sampling for flexible polypeptides. In addition, scoring of the poses was improved by post-processing with physics-based implicit solvent MM- GBSA calculations. Using the best RMSD among the top 10 scoring poses as a metric, the success rate (RMSD ≤ 2.0 {\AA} for the interface backbone atoms) increased from 21{\%} with default Glide SP settings to 58{\%} with the enhanced peptide sampling and scoring protocol in the case of redocking to the native protein structure. This approaches the accuracy of the recently developed Rosetta FlexPepDock method (63{\%} success for these 19 peptides) while being over 100 times faster. Cross-docking was performed for a subset of cases where an unbound receptor structure was available, and in that case, 40{\%} of peptides were docked successfully. We analyze the results and find that the optimized polypeptide protocol is most accurate for extended peptides of limited size and number of formal charges, defining a domain of applicability for this approach.},

abstract = {Transitions in wear rate and mechanism are a common feature of the erosive and abrasive wear of ceramics and other brittle materials. In such cases, a relatively small change in applied conditions, such as impact velocity or angle in the case of erosion, or of applied load in abrasion, results in a significant change in the mechanism of wear. Such a transition often represents a change in the extent or nature of fracture, leading to a concomitant change in the rate of material removal. Transitions in wear mechanism can also be associated with a change in the shape, hardness or size of the abrasive particles. In this paper, theoretical models for the onset of fracture and plastic flow in a material being eroded or abraded, and also in the abrasive or erosive particles, are used to define regimes over which a single wear mechanism will be dominant. A method is outlined by which these regimes can be illustrated graphically on plots of particle size against impact velocity or applied load, and it is suggested that in this way `maps' showing wear rates and mechanisms might be developed for the abrasive and erosive wear of brittle materials.},

abstract = {Extensive research on diamond and diamondlike carbon (DLC) films in our laboratory has further confirmed that hydrogen plays an important role in the tribological properties of these films. Specifically, model experiments in inert gas environments revealed a very close relationship between the hydrogen-to-carbon (H/C) ratios of source gases and the friction and wear coefficients of the resultant DLC films. The friction coefficient of films grown in source gases with very high H/C ratios (e.g.10) was superlow (0.003), whereas that of hydrogen-free DLC films (with essentially zero H/C ratio) was very high (0.65). The friction coefficients of films grown in source gases with intermediate H/C ratios were between 0.003 and 0.65. Experiments also revealed that the frictional properties of these films were very sensitive to test environments. Specifically, when tested in open air, the friction coefficient of hydrogen-free DLC dropped to 0.25, whereas that of highly-hydrogenated DLC increased to 0.06. Fundamental knowledge combined with surface analytical and tribological studies have led to the conclusion that the type and extent of chemical interactions between carbon-carbon, carbon-hydrogen, and carbon-adsorbate atoms at the sliding-contact interfaces determine the friction and wear properties of DLC films. {\textcopyright} 2001 Elsevier Science B.V.

abstract = {The constant demand for new materials is coupled with a growing interest in thin coatings that will improve the performance-related parameters of an element without increasing its volume or changing the material structure. The aim of this study was to determine the influence of TiN and CrN interlayers on the tribological properties of a-C:H:W-type diamond-like carbon (DLC) coatings deposited on HS6-5-2 steel using the physical vapor deposition (PVD) method. The effect of the interlayers was established by analyzing the structure, surface topography, chemical composition and tribological properties of the DLC coatings. The coatings were tested under dry friction conditions at the nano-, micro- and macroscales. An atomic force microscope (AFM) was employed to analyze the coating surface topography and perform tribological testing at the nanoscale. The microscale tests were conducted using a microtribometer, while the macroscale tests were carried out with a ball-on-disc contact tester. The results confirmed that the two interlayers improved the tribological properties of components with DLC coatings. {\textcopyright} 2014 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract = {This paper reviews studies of the performance of polymeric, metallic and ceramic including diamond coatings on steel and ceramic substrates when subjected to water–sand jet impingement erosion conditions. The coatings tested have been deposited by the thermal spray, electroless plating, PVD and CVD routes. The erosion conditions covered include sand impact velocities between 10 and 30 m/s with sand sizes 60–235 $\mu$m and at jet impingement angles of 30° and 90°. Tests compared the performance of the substrate material carbon steel AISI 1020 with the various polymeric, metallic and ceramic coatings. Coating and substrate erosion rates are plotted against mean particle impact energy, Ek or EkVp0.5 allowing easy surface selection once the erosion conditions of an application are known. The effect of jet impingement on the erosion resistance of selected coatings is presented. As with bulk materials, the slurry jet impingement angle and mean Ek must be considered in coating selection. Of the softer coatings tested the flexible polyurethane coatings seem to have promise for future use in fluid-borne sand particle erosion environments. Pure epoxy coatings show typical brittle erosion behaviour, with fusion-bonded epoxy having mixed ductile and brittle behaviour and glass fibre reinforced epoxy showing strong ductile behaviour. CVD deposited coatings of either boron carbide or diamond are the most resistant surfaces tested and outperform bulk ceramics such as silicon carbide by orders of magnitude for Ek{\textless}8 $\mu$J and 90° jet impingement angle. Areas requiring further research to allow accurate prediction of coating life are highlighted.},

abstract = {Nano-indentation, nano-scratch and nano-fretting tests were performed on highly polished Si(100) using a commercial ultra-low drift nano-mechanical test system (NanoTest, Micro Materials Ltd.) fitted with a 4.6 $\mu$m sphero-conical diamond indenter. In addition to plastic deformation, the contact deformation of Silicon is strongly affected by phase transformation and micro-/nano-fracture at room temperature. The objective of this work was to investigate the influence of tangential loading by comparison of deformation in the idealised loading in the nano-indentation test with the more complex tribo-contact situations. A novel method is introduced allowing quantitative comparison of deformation during loading in the nano-indentation, nano-scratch and nano-fretting tests. The loading curves in all three tests were almost identical at very low load. Tangential loading in the nano-scratch and nano-fretting tests promotes yield resulting in greater penetration depths at higher load than in nano-indentation. Contact damage assessment by in situ measurements of probe displacement during nano-fretting was supported by post-test SEM imaging and wear scar measurement by confocal microscopy. The nano-fretting crack morphology was related to the normal load applied and resulting track length. A brittle/ductile response of the material was observed, characterised by brittle micro-chips around wear track and ductile wear debris observed in the centre of the contact. The critical loads in the nano-scratch test show a subtle dependence on scan speed and loading rate. Pronounced lateral cracking observed in high load nano-scratch and nano-indentation tests is absent in the nano-fretting tests, which is consistent with the fretting wear process minimising the accumulation of strain. {\textcopyright} 2011 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract = {Raman spectroscopy is a very popular, non-destructive tool for the structural characterisation of carbons. Raman scattering from carbons is always a resonant process, in which those configurations whose band gaps match the excitation energy are preferentially excited. Any mixture of sp3, sp2and sp1carbon atoms always has a gap between 0 and 5.5 eV, and this energy range matches that of IR-vis-UV Raman spectrometers. The Raman spectra of carbons do not follow the vibration density of states, but consist of three basic features, the G and D peaks at approximately 1600 and 1350 cm-1and an extra T peak, for UV excitation, at ∼980-1060 cm-1. We propose to rationalise the vast range of experimental data available in literature at any excitation wavelenght by a simple model, which considers the main factors influencing the Raman spectra. The great advantages of multi-wavelenght Raman spectroscopy will be clarified by a series of examples. In particular we show how it can be used to probe the structural changes induced by annealing and by nitrogen introduction. UV Raman spectroscopy also probes heteropolar $\sigma$ bonds in a complementary way to infrared spectroscopy. We demonstrate the direct detection of C-H vibrations in hydrogenated DLC samples, Si-H and Si-C vibrations in amorphous silicon and amorphous silicon-carbon alloys and the easier probe of CN sp bonds in amorphous carbon nitrides. {\textcopyright} 2002 Elsevier Science B.V.

abstract = {Body fluids and relative motion between implant and bone lead to synergistic degradation reactions, which cause failed implantation or adverse tissue reactions for implant materials used in human body. Because of their good chemical biocompatibility as well as acceptable mechanical properties, titanium (CP Ti) and its alloys are widely used in implant applications. ??-type Ti alloys including alloying elements such as Nb, Zr and Mo have become more popular among the extensively used ??- and (??+. ??)-type Ti alloys due to their low elastic modulus, comparable mechanical properties and high biocompatibility. This paper was mainly aimed to investigate the electrochemical and tribological properties of ??-type Ti alloys. Also, traditionally used ??-type Ti (??- CP Ti) and (??+. ??) type Ti-6Al-4V (??/. ??- Ti64) alloys were included for comparing the same set of the results. The XRD and SEM investigations and hardness measurements were utilized to analyze the structure, surface morphology and mechanical behavior of the alloys. Simulated body fluid (SBF) was used as corrosive environment. Tribocorrosion tests were carried out at open circuit potential (OCP), cathodic and three different anodic potentials under reciprocating sliding condition. Potentiodynamic scans were obtained with and without wear test. Friction coefficient, current density and volume loss were measured and calculated. The relative motion accelerated the material loss in corrosive environment due to the combined effect of electrochemical reaction and tribological action. All Ti alloys had almost the same sensitivity to the potentiodynamic corrosion. The ratio of depassivation/repassivation affected wear performance of titanium and its alloys during tribocorrosion tests. The rate of chemical reaction was higher in ??-type Ti-15Mo (??- Ti15) and Ti-45Nb (??- Ti45) alloys as compared to others. The (??+. ??) type Ti-6Al-4V (??/. ??- Ti64) and ?? type Ti-13Nb-13Zr (??- Ti1313) showed lower volume loss and lower friction coefficient values during tribocorrosion tests than others. The corrosion resistance of the ??- Ti64 alloy exhibited better corrosion resistance than ??- Ti1313 alloy. However, considering the implants applications, the ??- Ti1313 alloy may be a good candidate with relatively low elastic modulus and without toxic alloying elements.},

DLC films were deposited on silicon and quartz substrates under 1 × 10- 6Torr pressure at different temperatures from room temperature to 250 °C. The effect of temperature on the electrical and optical properties of the DLC films was studied. Laser Raman Spectroscopy (LRS) showed that the DLC band showed a slight increase to higher frequency with increasing film deposition temperature. Spectroscopic ellipsometry (SE) and ultraviolet-visible absorption spectroscopy showed that the optical band gap of the DLC films was 0.8-2 eV and decreased with increasing substrate temperature. These results were consistent with the electrical resistivity results, which gave values for the films in the range 1.0 × 104-2.8 × 105$\Omega$ cm and which also decreased with deposition temperature. We conclude that at higher substrate deposition temperatures, DLC films show increasing graphitic characteristics yielding lower electrical resistivity and a smaller optical band gap. {\textcopyright} 2010 Elsevier B.V.

abstract = {The determination of the sliding conditions is of primary importance in describing the loading conditions in a fretting contact. Cracking is mainly observed under partial slip condition [1] whereas gross slip situation with high dissipated energy promotes wear and debris formation. To quantify such sliding conditions, various adimensional criteria have been recently introduced. They allow the quantification of the transition between partial slip to gross slip for sphere/flat contacts through various constants [2]. This study focuses on recent developments, where the sliding criteria are studied, taking into account the time evolution. This permits the formalisation of the concept of fretting regime [3] and more particularly the mixed regime which corresponds to sliding transitions during the test. Moreover the local friction coefficient in the partial slip external annulus can be estimated by combining the sliding ratio with the tangential force evolution. This fundamental study of friction is compared to experiments on a sphere/flat situation with steel contacts. Theoretical local friction coefficient analysis is then compared to local observations in the wear scar obtained under partial slip. The local friction value is related to various distributions of strong metal/metal shear stress interactions and more accommodative debris layers. It is shown that the mixed slip regime is associated with a decrease of the contact dissipated energy which indirectly interacts on the extension of the stick domain and then an increase of the local friction coefficient in the annular sliding zone.},

abstract = {The paper is devoted to an assessment of the mechanical behavior of hard and superhard nanocomposite coatings from loading/ unloading curves measured by a computer-controlled Fischerscope H 100 microhardness tester and a maximum depth dmaxof the diamond indenter impression into the coating at a given load L. It is shown that: (1) the area between the loading/unloading curve and the value of dmaxdecreases with increasing (i) hardness H, (ii) effective Young's modulus E =E/(1-v2) and (iii) universal hardness HU, where E and v are the Young's modulus and the Poisson ratio, respectively; and (2) there is no simple relation between the mechanical response of the coating and H or E alone; however, this response is strongly dependent on the ratio H/E. The last fact gives a possibility of tailoring the mechanical properties of a coating for a given application, e.g. to prepare coatings with high hardness H, high resistance to plastic deformation (ΟH3/E2), high elastic recovery Wc, but with low E and high dmax. Special attention is also given to the analysis of problems in accurately measuring the hardness of superhard (≥60 GPa) coatings. It is shown that a high elastic recovery Wc≥80{\%} of superhard films with H≥60 GPa (1) strongly decreases the gradient dH/dL and (2) shifts the region L, where H(L) ≈ constant and the hardness H is correctly measured, to higher values of L. This means that the lowest load L used in the hardness measurement must be higher than L used in measurements of coatings with H{\textless}60 GPa to prevent the value of H measured from being significantly higher than the real hardness of the coating. {\textcopyright} 2002 Elsevier Science B.V.

abstract = {A fretting experiment with separate control of bulk stress, normal and tangential contact loads is presented. For the initial test series, constant normal and bulk loads were combined with a cyclic tangential load. Both the spherical indenter and the plane specimen were manufactured from $\alpha$+$\beta$ titanium alloys. Strain gauges and acoustic emission measurements were employed for the determination of the time to crack initiation and the propagation life. The fretting cracks always initiated inside the slip zone at positions that were spread over the whole slip zone. Crack nucleation was investigated with five multiaxial fatigue criteria. It was concluded that macroscale stresses from the contact and bulk load alone could not explain all aspects of crack initiation. A possible explanation was found in the fretting-induced roughness. The growth of the fretting crack was simulated numerically by a parametrical description. It was noted that a cyclic bulk load was required to drive the crack growth through the specimen to final failure. {\textcopyright} 2006 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

abstract = {Bulk metallic glasses (BMGs) are potential candidate materials for numerous structural applications. However, this class of materials has a major limitation for engineering applications due to their inferior resistance to fatigue wear. In present work, a novel micro-scale repetitive impact test was utilized for fatigue testing of ZrCu-based BMGs (Zr63.6-xCu18Ni10.4Al8Fex, x = 0, 3, 5 at.{\%}), and specific attention was paid to the micro-alloying effect on wear resistance. Transmission electron microscopy of as-cast Zr58.6Cu18Ni10.4Al8Fe5 revealed amorphous structure with the formation of a second glassy phase of few nanometers in diameter. Although these structural changes have minor effects on hardness and modulus, they have a substantial influence on fatigue wear resistance. Phase separation was found to promote numerous shear bands, which induced strain hardening, and improved the crack resistance. Consequently, all these features are considered to contribute the improved wear resistance. On the contrary, a monolithic glass without Fe addition lacks any microstructural features that can provide means for the local arrest of shear bands and incipient fatigue cracks. These findings improve the understanding of the impact fatigue mechanisms and provide suggestions for the future design of BMGs with excellent wear performance.},

abstract = {The effect of precursor gases on the diamond-like carbon (DLC) film deposition was investigated in the r.f. plasma-assisted CVD method. DLC films were deposited using methane or benzene as the precursor gas. The residual stresses, hardnesses, total hydrogen concentrations and electron energy loss spectra were compared at the same value of VbP12. (Here, Vb is the self-bias voltage of cathode and P the deposition pressure.) The values of VbP12 ranges from 33 to 250 V mTorr−12 for methane and from 33 to 900 V mTorr−12 for benzene by changing the negative bias voltage from −100 to −900 V and deposition pressure from 1 to 100 mTorr. We observed significant differences between the structures and properties of these films. In the same range of VbP12 the structure and properties of films deposited from benzene show characteristic behaviors of lower energy deposition than those from methane. The present observations are discussed in terms of the difference in the ion energy per carbon atom at the growth surface. The total hydrogen concentration in the films deposited from benzene is smaller by about 7 at.{\%} in this experimental range.},

The present study shows the results which have been obtained using titanium nitride and diamond-like carbon coatings 5 $\mu$m thick deposited on high speed steel. The fretting experiments were conducted with a 10 mm diameter steel ball (AISI 52100) sliding on a coated flat surface with a normal load ranging from 100 to 500 N. The sliding amplitude (peak-to-peak displacement) of the ball is constant during the test, that is between 5 and 50 $\mu$m. The experiments were performed under room atmosphere at ambient temperature. The results obtained demonstrate the changes related to the presence of the coating: the fretting maps are modified because of a different surface nature and mechanical properties. An energy ratio (dissipated energy divided by total energy during a fretting cycle) has been found to be very useful to describe the contact phenomena. {\textcopyright} 1994.},

abstract = {A simple technique to measure the elastic modulus and Poisson's ratio of diamond-like carbon (DLC) films deposited on Si substrate was suggested. This technique involved etching a side of Si substrate using the DLC film as an etching mask. The edge of the DLC overhang, which is free from constraint of the Si substrate, exhibits periodic sinusoidal shape. By measuring the amplitude and the wavelength of the sinusoidal edge, we can determine the strain of the film required to adhere to the substrate. Combined with an independent stress measurement by laser reflection method this technique allows calculation of the biaxial elastic modulus, E/(1 - $\nu$) where E is the elastic modulus and $\nu$ Poisson's ratio of the DLC films. By comparing the biaxial elastic modulus with plane-strain modulus E/(1 - $\nu$2) measured by nanoindentation, we could further determine the elastic modulus and Poisson's ratio, independently. The mechanical properties of DLC films deposited by r.f. PACVD were characterized using this technique. The films were prepared by using C6H6 r.f. glow discharge at a self bias voltage of 400 V and a deposition pressure of 1.33 Pa. The elastic modulus and Poisson's ratio were 87 ± 18 GPa and 0.22 ± 0.33, respectively. The effects of the etching depth and the film thickness were also discussed.},

abstract = {This paper begins by reviewing the history of interface friction of organic films in terms of the measurement and interpretation of these phenomena using microscopic models. The interface friction is considered to arise from the shear or flow of the organic film and the prime characteristic is taken as the interface shear stress, denoted as $\tau$. The influence of contact pressure, temperature and sliding velocity is described in general terms. The essence of the established models is based upon the belief that microscopic entities, such as side groups or chain segments, are engaged within the shear plane and thereby transfer frictional work into the film which is ultimately dissipated as heat by phonon wave damping. The value and success of these models is assessed. An alternative approach is suggested which seeks to use vibrational spectroscopy as a means of identifying the characteristics of the microscopic units active in the shear plane. The data are preliminary, but indicate that this method has potential for identifying the species responsible for accommodating the microscopic strain and also for characterizing the environment in which these species flow. {\textcopyright} 1992.},

abstract = {TiC/a-C:H nanocomposite coatings, deposited with closed-field unbalanced magnetron sputtering, have been scrutinized with atomic force, scanning and high-resolution transmission electron microscopy, nanoindentation and tribo-tests. These coatings consist of 2-5 nm TiC nanocrystallites embedded in an amorphous hydrocarbon (a-C:H) matrix. A transition from a columnar to a glassy microstructure has been observed in the nanocomposite coatings with increasing substrate bias or carbon content. Microcracks induced by nanoindentation or sliding wear readily propagate through the column boundaries whereas the coatings without a columnar microstructure exhibit substantial toughness. The toughening of the nanocomposite coatings has been achieved effectively on two different scales, namely by restraining the formation of columns on a microscale and by manipulating the nanostructure on a nanoscale. The hardness (H) and elastic modulus (E) of the coatings are found to increase monotonically with increasing substrate bias, whereas the ratio of the hardness to the elastic modulus (H/E) remains approximately constant. In contrast, H/E increases with C content. Ball-on-disc tribo-tests confirm that the nanocomposite coatings possess superior wear resistance and strong self-lubrication effects with a coefficient of friction as low as 0.05 in ambient air and below 0.02 in dry air, under dry sliding against uncoated bearing steel balls. Physical arguments are presented to explain the toughening mechanism and the ultra-low friction. {\textcopyright} 2005 Acta Materialia Inc. Published by Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

abstract = {Diamond-Like Carbon (DLC) coatings are well known for offering excellent tribological properties. They have been shown to offer low friction and outstanding wear performance in both dry and lubricated conditions. Application of these coatings for automotive components is considered as a promising strategy to cope with the emerging requirements regarding fuel economy and durability. Commercially available oils are generally optimised to work on conventional ferrous surfaces and are not necessarily effective in lubricating non-ferrous surfaces. Recently, the adverse effect of the Molybdenum DialkyldithioCarbamate (MoDTC) friction modifier additive on the wear performance of the hydrogenated DLC has been reported. However, the mechanisms by which MoDTC imposes this high wear to DLC are not yet well understood. A better understanding of DLC wear may potentially lead to better compatibility between DLC surfaces and current additive technology being achieved. In this work, the wear properties of DLC coatings in the DLC/cast iron (CI) system under boundary lubrication conditions have been investigated to try to understand what appears to be a tribocorrosion-type process. A pin-on-plate tribotester was used to run the experiments using High Speed Steel (HSS) plates coated with 15 at.{\{}{\%}{\}} hydrogenated DLC (a-C:15H) sliding against CI pins or ceramic balls. The lubricants used in this study are typical examples of the same fully formulated oil with and without ZDDP. The friction and wear responses of the fully formulated oils are discussed in detail. Furthermore, Optical Microscopy (OM) and Scanning Electron Microscopy (SEM), Energy-Dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDX), Focused Ion Beam (FIB) and Transmission Electron Microscopy (TEM) were used to observe the wear scar and propose wear mechanisms. The X-ray Photoelectron Spectroscopy (XPS) analysis was performed on the tribofilms to understand the tribochemical interactions between oil additives and the DLC coating. Nano-indentation analysis was conducted to assess potential structural modifications of the DLC coating. Coating hardness data could provide a better insight into the wear mode and failure mechanism of such hard coatings. Given the obtained results, the wear behaviour of the hydrogenated DLC coating was found to depend not only on the presence of ZDDP in the oil formulation but also on the counterpart type. This study revealed that the steel counterpart is a critical component of the tribocouple leading to MoDTC-induced wear of the hydrogenated DLC.},

abstract = {Modularity of total hip arthroplasty (THA) has been linked to various forms of adverse local tissue reaction (ALTR). ALTR is often a result of metallic particles and ions released from corroding implant materials to the peri-prosthetic tissues and blood stream of the human body. More so, it is a consequence of several fretting and crevice-induced corrosion mechanisms occurring simultaneously. Fretting corrosion and fatigue damage of the modular taper is initiated and sustained by micromotions at the taper interface through the multi-directional loads applied onto the prosthesis during daily living activities. Subsequent to the failure of the implant, analysis of retrieved explants generally offer information regarding the mode of wear and to an extent, the types of corrosion damage. However, retrieval studies are limited in that, they do not provide a holistic insight into the in-vivo degradation mechanisms which ultimately led to the early failure of the implant. On the other hand, controlled in-vitro studies proves useful for replicating the evolution of wear and corrosion in-situ. In addition, the role of multiple individual factors which contribute to fretting corrosion can be elucidated through in-vitro methods. In this study, metal – metal and ceramic – metal fretting interfaces were investigated. Advance microscopy and spectroscopy techniques were employed in the characterisation of passive films, corrosion products and metallurgical transformations of CoCrMo and Ti6Al4V alloys. Both mechanical and electrochemical data consisting of interfacial energy, open circuit potential (OCP) and fretting corrosion currents were measured using an in-situ tribocorrosion cell. Other surface analytical techniques were used to quantify wear and obtain surface topography. The results showed that CoCrMo and Ti6Al4V display independent characteristic behaviours when in a metal – metal or ceramic – metal fretting contact. For example, fretting contacts involving Ti6Al4V experienced higher contact compliance than those of CoCrMo. The higher interfacial compliance vii thus led to a significant proportion of wear being redistributed at the contacts involving Ti6Al4V alloys. It was subsequently observed that the redistributed wear at the interface leads to a mixed fretting regime whereby, the contact appear to be ‘cold-welded' during a partial-slip regime and subsequently transitions to a gross slip fretting regime when the ‘welded' interfacial material fractures. The phenomena was evident in both metal – metal and ceramic – metal interfaces involving Ti6Al4V. The subsurface transformation in CoCrMo alloy when subjected to fretting was observed to be typically strain-induced twinning and loss of nano-crystalline region. On the other hand, Ti6Al4V alloy was observed to be strain-induced recrystallization, mechanical mixing, crack initiation and propagation. It was also observed that the chemical composition of fretting corrosion products at the metal – metal interfaces were dependent on the contact condition and the specific area within the contact that the wear product is located. For example, metal–oxides and chlorides were prominent within creviced regions whilst precipitation of metal-phosphates and metal–oxides were present in well aerated regions. Evidence of Cr6+ and pitting corrosion products were also identified at the most severe creviced environment of the CoCrMo – Ti6Al4V fretting contact. This research also showed that the evolution of fretting corrosion current (specifically in self-mated CoCrMo contact) can be linked to the surface history of wear and corrosion. Furthermore, studies conducted on realistic taper components revealed that the use of ceramic bearings in order to eliminate one of two conductive components only resulted in the reduction of static corrosion currents but not fretting corrosion currents. Rather, it was deduced that interference fit at the ceramic – metal interface (relative to metal – metal) increases the surface area that is susceptible to passive oxide abrasion under fretting conditions. Therefore, the use of a ceramic bearing did not reduce fretting current at the modular taper interface.},

abstract = {Carbon electrodes are widely used in electrochemistry due to their low cost, wide potential window, and low and stable background noise. Carbon-fiber electrodes (CFE) are commonly used to electrochemically measure "quantal" catecholamine release via exocytosis from individual cells, but it is difficult to integrate CFEs into lab-on-a-chip devices. Here we report the development of nitrogen doped diamond-like carbon (DLC:N) microelectrodes on a chip to monitor quantal release of catecholamines from cells. Advantages of DLC:N microelectrodes are that they are batch producible at low cost, and are harder and more durable than graphite films. The DLC:N microelectrodes were prepared by a magnetron sputtering process with nitrogen doping. The 30 microm by 40 microm DLC:N microelectrodes were patterned onto microscope glass slides by photolithography and lift-off technology. The properties of the DLC:N microelectrodes were characterized by AFM, Raman spectroscopy and cyclic voltammetry. Quantal catecholamine release was recorded amperometrically from bovine adrenal chromaffin cells on the DLC:N microelectrodes. Amperometric spikes due to quantal release of catecholamines were similar in amplitude and area as those recorded using CFEs and the background current and noise levels of microchip DLC:N electrodes were also comparable to CFEs. Therefore, DLC:N microelectrodes are suitable for microchip-based high-throughput measurement of quantal exocytosis with applications in basic research, drug discovery and cell-based biosensors.},

abstract = {According to relative motion directions for a ball-on-flat contact, there are four fundamental fretting wear modes, e.g., tangential, radial, torsional and rotational modes. In this paper, the mechanisms of these four fundamental fretting wear modes, particularly for the later three modes, have been reviewed from results obtained by the authors in combination with results from literature. Some general features have been reported. Differences both in running and degradation behavior have been discussed in detail. Results showed that some similar laws for three fretting regimes (partial slip regime, mixed regime and slip regime), fretting maps (running condition fretting map and material response fretting map), wear and cracking mechanisms obtained from the classic mode (i.e. tangential fretting) were also identified and useful to characterize the other modes. Nevertheless, the occurrence of relative slip for the radial fretting, the formation of mixed regime for the torsional fretting, the evolution of surface morphology for the rotational fretting were quite different compared to that of the classical fretting mode. {\textcopyright} 2011 Elsevier Ltd.},

abstract = {With an atomic force microscopy, the tangential nanofretting behaviors of monocrystalline silicon (1 0 0) were investigated by using spherical diamond tips under atmosphere and vacuum conditions, respectively. Different from fretting, the nanofretting damage of silicon may successively experience two progresses, the generation of hillocks and grooves, with the increase in normal load. The critical contact pressure corresponding to the transition of the damage mode was found to be close to the hardness of Si(1 0 0). Due to the absence of water and oxygen in vacuum, the tangential force in nanofretting was a little lower than that in atmosphere. Compared to those in atmosphere, the nanofretting scars in vacuum exhibited higher hillock at low load but shallower groove at high load, which could be explained as the "soft coating" effect of oxide layer on Si(1 0 0) surface.

Thick DJX films grown by conventional r.f. self bias technique often delaminate from the substrate5 due to the presence of high compressive stresses of the order of 4-7 GPa. We have made an in-depth study of the delamination problem of DLC films at NPL and found thut only for substrates kept away from the plasma (plume) it is possible to grow thick DLC films. This goes to show the heating of the substrates. when in contact with the plasma. appears to be one of the most important factors giving rise to the high stress values. Techniques that have produced consistently low stress values (0.2-0.5 GPa) in this laboratory are pulse plasma PECVD and the one using dc saddle field fast atom beam source. Electronic properties of the materials so produced have been estimated by evaluating Urbach energy using photothermal deflection spectroscopy (PDS) measurements. A correlation between the unbound hydrogen in these films, as measured by a nuclear technique (ERDA), and the stress levels has been found. Deposition rate, room temperature conductivity, optical bandgap and refractive index have also been measured for these films. 0 1999},

In the first sequence, the 52100 steel balls are mated by a 60-minute run-in at 40 Kg load under fully flooded conditions using a 78 centistoke at 40°C white oil. The second segment of the test is run with up to five microliters of the desired lubricant. Lubricant failure in this sequence is defined as a sharp rise in friction, indicating a lack of lubricant supply to the conjunction. Lubricant changes resulting in the failure are determined by a gel permeation chromatography (GPC) analysis of the lubricant at the time of failure compared with the GPC analysis of the new lubricant used, in the lest. Failure appears to occur where the degraded lubricant becomes too thick to flow into the conjunction. In most cases, a relatively small amount of severely oxidized lubricant forms a grease-like mixture containing a relatively large amount of un-reacted. lubricant. The life of lubricants in these tests appears to be dependant, on the reactions driven by frictional heating that take place between the lubricant, dissolved oxygen, and the bearing surface.

Hydrogen-free amorphous carbon (a-C) coatings were first deposited by CVAE about two decades after the first description of hydrogenated a-C coatings (a-C:H) deposited by glow-discharge techniques. This paper highlights the development and broad potential of hard a-C coatings deposited by direct (DCVAE) and filtered (FCVAE) cathodic arc evaporation, including pulsed arc.DLC films offer a wide range of exceptional physical (optical, electrical), chemical (interaction with media), mechanical (hardness, elastic modulus), biomedical and tribological properties. Monolithic tetrahedrally-bonded hydrogen-free coatings (ta-C) provide the highest hardness, while various softer a-C coatings are also useful in some applications. Many film properties such as electrical conductivity and surface energy can be modified by alloying with elements such as H, N, Si, B, F, P and metals. Recent research and industrial solutions for generating DLC coatings by CVAE of carbon-based cathodes are described, and hybrid methods using metal cathodes and gas-phase sources are discussed. Coatings containing additional elements and having complex architectures are also discussed, and selected properties for various coating types are presented.The number of industrial applications of ta-C and a-C coatings continues to increase, mainly for tribological coatings to reduce wear and friction. Various applications of coatings deposited by CVAE are described, including data hard disks, engine parts, razor blades, valve seals, decorative coatings, cutting and forming tools, biomedical products and others.},

abstract = {The Raman spectra of a wide range of disordered and amorphous carbons have been measured under excitation from 785 to 229 nm. The dispersion of peak positions and intensities with excitation wavelength is used to understand the nature of resonant Raman scattering in carbon and how to derive the local bonding and disorder from the Raman spectra. The spectra show three basic features, the D and G around 1600 and 1350 cm-1 for visible excitation and an extra T peak, for UV excitation, at ∼1060 cm-1. The G peak, due to the stretching motion of sp2 pairs, is a good indicator of disorder. It shows dispersion only in amorphous networks, with a dispersion rate proportional to the degree of disorder. Its shift well above 1600 cm-1 under UV excitation indicates the presence of sp2 chains. The dispersion of the D peak is strongest in ordered carbons. It shows little dispersion in amorphous carbon, so that in UV excitation it becomes like a density-of-states feature of vibrations of sp2 ringlike structures. The intensity ratio I(D)/I(G) falls with increasing UV excitation in all forms of carbon, with a faster decrease in more ordered carbons, so that it is generally small for UV excitation. The T peak, due to sp3 vibrations, only appears in UV Raman, lying around 1060 cm-1 for H-free carbons and around 980 cm-1 in hydrogenated carbons. In hydrogenated carbons, the sp3C−Hx stretching modes around 2920 cm-1 can be clearly detected for UV excitation. This assignment is confirmed by deuterium substitution.},

The technique provides a new approach to the investigation of the fracture properties of thin films. Single-point impact data for brittle materials, such as DLC films, show an initial period of damage generation followed by catastrophic failure. The time-to-failure and the overall change in probe depth during a test are measures of the resistance of the coating to fracture.

abstract = {The abrasive and erosive wear behaviour of titanium nitride coatings prepared using physical vapour deposition has been studied and the mechanism(s) by which the coatings fail identified and contrasted with those of uncoated material similarly treated. For abrasive wear it is not sufficient to consider only hardness as a guide to coating selection; it is also important to consider the load-bearing capacity of the coating/substrate system. Under mild abrasive wear, thin coatings eventually fail by localized detachment of the film at the intersections of the plastic grooves formed by the abrasive particles, whilst thicker coatings support the contact stresses elastically and degrade by a microchipping or polishing mechanism with little or no deformation of the underlying substrate. In contrast, under severe abrasive wear, thick coatings fail by a cohesive fracture mechanism. Under erosive conditions it is found that thick coatings are more resistant to angular particle erosion whilst thin coatings have longer lifetimes when exposed to blunt erodents. Whilst no correlation can be found between erosion resistance and the scratch-adhesion critical load for failure Lc, good correlations between the failure mechanism(s) found in erosion and scratch testing can be made. The role of internal stress and substrate type in erosion and scratch behaviour has also been studied, high internal stresses being found to induce spalling in both erosion and scratch tests. {\textcopyright} 1987.},

abstract = {In this study, we introduce a new diamondlike carbon (DLC) film providing a friction coefficient of 0.001 and wear rates of 10-9–10-10 mm3/N m in inert-gas environments (e.g., dry nitrogen and argon). The film was grown on steel and sapphire substrates in a plasma enhanced chemical vapor deposition system that uses a hydrogen-rich plasma. Employing a combination of surface and structure analytical techniques, we explored the structural chemistry of the resultant DLC films and correlated these findings with the friction and wear mechanisms of the films. The results of tribological tests under a 10 N load (creating initial peak Hertz pressures of 1 and 2.2 GPa on steel and sapphire test pairs, respectively) and at 0.2 to 0.5 m/s sliding velocities indicated that a close correlation exists between the friction and wear coefficients of DLC films and the source gas chemistry. Specifically, films grown in source gases with higher hydrogen-to-carbon ratios had the lowest friction coefficients and the highest wear resistance. The lowest friction coefficient (0.001) was achieved with a film on sapphire substrates produced in a gas discharge plasma consisting of 25{\%} methane and 75{\%} hydrogen.},

In compression, the deviations of the observed slip planes from the planes of maximum resolved shear stress were greater than in tension but were towards {\{}110{\}}, and were greater at 77°K.

For example, coefficient of friction has shown to vary as a function of load cycles and so-called non-Coulomb friction can exist during individual load cycles. Concepts of stable and unstable friction are presented in this manuscript. Based on experiments, no fretting is to be expected if the utilization of friction is kept below unstable friction threshold. If contact is subjected to tangential load above this threshold, reciprocating slippage, fretting, is to be expected even if the contact was initially in stick. Experimental evidence for existence of such threshold is presented in form of friction data, slip data and fretting scars.},

abstract = {Diamond-ike carbon (DLC) coatings have been investigated with respect to biocompatibility, mechanical stability under biofluid exposure, corrosion resistance and the impact of the fabrication or operation of catheter guidewires and stents upon coating integrity. High mechanical tensile and compressive forces, during guidewire winding or stent expansion, pose severe limitations on the use of DLC-coated stainless steel. Doping with silicon and the use of an a-Si:H interlayer can help minimise the risk of adhesion failure or film cracking. The incorporation of Si increased the hydrogen content and the estimated sp3fraction but reduced the film hardness. Silicon-doped a-C:H coatings exhibit significantly improved corrosion barrier properties, with over two orders of magnitude increase in the charge transfer resistance. Immersion in biofluid, however, reduced the interfacial adhesion strength by up to 75{\%}. Human microvascular endothelial cell attachment was enhanced while platelet attachment was reduced on Si-doped compared to undoped a-C:H. The macrophage response to non-hydrogenated tetragonal (t-aC) carbon show that these coatings stimulate less inflammatory activity than uncoated materials and produce comparable responses to already existing polyurethane coatings. {\textcopyright} 2004 Published by Elsevier B.V.},

abstract = {Residual stresses and strains in a material can be determined by using various experimental measuring techniques. This chapter discusses one of the simple and inexpensive measuring method, namely sharp indentation testing. Presently, sharp indentation is adhered to due to the fact that hardness and relative contact area are independent of indentation depth (due to the fact that the problem is mathematically self-similar with no characteristic length) and this is a particular advantage at interpretation of the results. Furthermore, the emphasis on nanoindentation testing also suggests that sharp indentation is the feature of most interest presently. The chapter also discusses and outlines a solution strategy for the determination of residual stresses by indentation. The solution strategy will mainly concentrate on equi-biaxial residual stresses in low hardening materials but also a general approach is discussed.},

In addition, high temperature tribological tests were conducted in inert atmosphere in the same temperature range to obtain information about the coefficient of friction and the wear coefficient. In order to link the tribological behavior to the obtained mechanical properties, the H/E* ratio was calculated and compared to the high temperature wear from the current and other studies with similar coatings.

abstract = {The tribological study of materials inherently involves the interaction of surface asperities at the micro to nanoscopic length scales. This is the case for large scale engineering applications with sliding contacts, where the real area of contact is made up of small contacting asperities that make up only a fraction of the apparent area of contact. This is why researchers have sought to create idealized experiments of single asperity contacts in the field of nanotribology. At the same time, small scale engineering structures known as micro- and nano-electromechanical systems (MEMS and NEMS) have been developed, where the apparent area of contact approaches the length scale of the asperities, meaning the real area of contact for these devices may be only a few asperities. This is essentially the field of microtribology, where the contact size and/or forces involved have pushed the nature of the interaction between two surfaces towards the regime where the scale of the interaction approaches that of the natural length scale of the features on the surface. This paper provides a review of microtribology with the purpose to understand how tribological processes are different at the smaller length scales compared to macrotribology. Studies of the interfacial phenomena at the macroscopic length scales (e.g., using in situ tribometry) will be discussed and correlated with new findings and methodologies at the micro-length scale.},

abstract = {Diamond-like carbon (DLC) is a dense, partially sp3 bonded metastable phase of non-crystalline carbon or hydrogenated amorphous carbon formed by the deposition from medium energy (50-500 eV) ion beams. The sp3 bonding arises from C ions entering subsurface atomic sites and producing a quenched-in density increase. The process has an optimum ion energy of about 100 eV because the C ions must have sufficient energy to penetrate the surface, but any excess energy could anneal out the density increment. The process is an ion-induced compression of sp2 a-C into the denser sp3 phase. Deposition of a-C: H is more complex, involving a growth step, ion-induced dehydrogenation and ion-induced compression of the C-C skeleton. In the growth step, ions incorporate directly into the films whereas slow neutral species first form an adsorbed layer which then may incorporate into the bulk. Ion bombardment causes dehydrogenation by the preferential displacement of hydrogen and compresses sp2 sites into sp3 sites, forming extra bonds in the C-C skeleton, as in a-C. {\textcopyright} 1994.},

It has been demonstrated that the state of the art PAPVD processes operate in a plasma density range of 10{\^{}}11 to 10{\^{}}13 cm{\^{}}−3. In this range a substantial fraction of the plasma consists of ionized film forming species. Hence, the energy of the condensing film forming species can be directly controlled, as opposed to utilizing indirect energy control with, for example, ionized inert gas bombardment. For a large variety of applications ranging from ceramic film synthesis at conditions far from thermodynamic equilibrium to state of the art metallization technology, such direct energy control of the condensing film forming species is of critical importance, and offers the possibility to engineer the coating microstructure and hence the coating properties.},

@article{Zhou1995,
abstract = {The mixed fretting regime (MFR) has been proven to be the most dangerous regime for crack nucleation and service failure. It can be identified from the evolution of the "tangential load-displacement" loops, i.e. when there is a variation in the shape of the loops. Usually elliptical (partial slip) and quasi-rectangular (gross slip) loops are encountered in MFR. This regime has been obtained in fretting wear and fretting fatigue tests on numerous metal- base alloys. In contrast with the classic stick-slip condition in Mindlin's elastic theory, MFR depends strongly on the normal load, the imposed amplitude and material properties such as elongation. During fretting testing under MFR, the material can fail due to overstraining or overstressing and the location of the maximum varies. For ductile materials, a competition exists between the formation of the tribologically transformed structure, particle detachment and the nucleation of fatigue cracks. In the case of brittle materials, MFR is generally avoided due to the rapid formation of debris and the establishment of a third body layer in which easier velocity accommodation favours the gross slip condition. A mechanical and material approach is used to analyse the specific behaviour of materials submitted to MFR. The study of fretting crack nucleation and propagation is emphasized. {\textcopyright} 1995.},

abstract = {The performance of chemical mechanical polishing (CMP) has been found highly dependent on the pad-workpiece contact status, which is far from theoretical understanding. To this end, a physically-based material removal rate (MRR) model is developed under pad-asperity scale. The theoretical predictions agree well with the experimental results no matter the contact spots distribution is dispersed or concentrated. It is found that the deterioration of MRR is attributed to the continuously reduced number of reacted atoms in each individual contact spot and the inadequate time for chemical reaction between successive contact spots. The present model is expected to facilitate the clarification of the effect of contact status on MRR, and further provide a strategy for CMP mechanisms investigation.},

@article{Pearson2015,
abstract = {More than 25 years ago, Vingsbo and S{\"{o}}derberg published a seminal paper regarding the mapping of behaviour in fretting contacts (O. Vingsbo, S. S{\"{o}}derberg, On fretting maps, Wear, 126 (1988) 131-147). In this paper, it was proposed that in the gross-slip fretting regime, the wear coefficient increased by between one and two orders of magnitude as the fretting displacement amplitude increased from around 20. $\mu$m to 300. $\mu$m (defined as the limits of the gross-slip regime).Since the publication of this paper, there have been many papers published in the literature regarding fretting in the gross-sliding regime where such a strong dependence of wear coefficient upon fretting displacement has not been observed, with instead, the wear coefficient being shown to be almost independent of fretting amplitude. Indeed, many researchers have demonstrated that there is a good correlation between wear volume and frictional energy dissipated in the contact for many material combinations, with the additional insight that a threshold in energy dissipated in the contact exists, below which no wear is observed (experimental data relating to fretting of a high-strength steel is presented in the current paper which supports this concept).It is argued that in deriving a wear coefficient in fretting, there are two key considerations which have not always been addressed: (i) the far-field displacement amplitude is not an adequate substitute for the slip amplitude (the former is the sum of the latter together with any elastic deformation in the system between the contact and the point at which the displacement is measured); and (ii) there is a threshold in the fretting duration, below which no wear occurs and above which the rate of increase in wear volume with increasing duration is constant (this constant may be termed the wear coefficient, k{\textless}inf{\textgreater}true{\textless}/inf{\textgreater}). Not addressing these two issues results in the derivation of a nominal wear coefficient (k{\textless}inf{\textgreater}nominal{\textless}/inf{\textgreater}) which is always less than k{\textless}inf{\textgreater}true{\textless}/inf{\textgreater}. A simple analysis is presented which indicates that k{\textless}inf{\textgreater}nominal{\textless}/inf{\textgreater}/k{\textless}inf{\textgreater}true{\textless}/inf{\textgreater} = 1-A-B where A is associated with erroneously utilising the far-field displacement amplitude in place of the contact slip amplitude in the calculation of the wear coefficient and B is associated with the failure to recognise that there is a threshold in fretting duration below which no wear occurs.A and B are shown to depend upon the tractional force required to initiate sliding (itself dependent upon the applied load and coefficient of friction), the system stiffness, the applied displacement amplitude, the threshold fretting duration below which no wear occurs and the number of fretting cycles in the test. Using typical values of these parameters, the ratio of k{\textless}inf{\textgreater}nominal{\textless}/inf{\textgreater} to k{\textless}inf{\textgreater}true{\textless}/inf{\textgreater} has been shown to be strongly dependent upon the applied displacement amplitude over the range addressed by Vingsbo and S{\"{o}}derberg (with the ratio rapidly decreasing by an order of magnitude over this range). As such, it is argued that k{\textless}inf{\textgreater}true{\textless}/inf{\textgreater} shows no strong dependence on slip amplitude in fretting, and that the strong dependence of k{\textless}inf{\textgreater}nominal{\textless}/inf{\textgreater} upon displacement amplitude presented by Vingsbo and S{\"{o}}derberg does not imply a change in k{\textless}inf{\textgreater}true{\textless}/inf{\textgreater} as is often inferred.The routine recording of force-displacement loops in fretting is a major experimental advancement which has taken place since the publication of the paper by Vingsbo and S{\"{o}}derberg. It is argued that this technique must be routinely used to allow the correct interpretation of wear data in terms of the actual slip amplitude (or energy dissipated); moreover, a range of conditions should be experimentally examined to allow the threshold fretting duration below which no wear has occurred to be evaluated and its significance assessed.},

Variations of the technique allow measurements related to: impact wear and adhesion failure, erosive wear resistance, fracture toughness, work hardening, and dynamic hardness. The common element in each variant is the acceleration of a test probe (usually diamond) towards the specimen surface and the monitoring its instantaneous position before and after collision. The impact energy can be controlled and either single impacts or multiple impacts can be produced. For single impacts, the energy delivered to the contact point can be quantified, allowing calculation of a dynamic hardness number.},

Hydrogenated DLC (H-DLC) coatings were prepared by radio frequency plasma enhanced chemical vapour deposition process. Raman scattering measurements were done on the coatings. Fretting wear tests were conducted at different normal loads using a fretting wear test rig working on scotch yoke mechanism. Wear scars on the tested specimens were observed using an optical microscope. Wear volume was calculated based on wear scar diameter measured along parallel and perpendicular to the fretting direction. Tangential force coefficient (TFC) values exhibited by DLC coated samples were lower than those exhibited by uncoated specimens in both ambient air and Ringer solution. Very low TFC values and low wear volume were observed for H-DLC coated samples tested in air at lower loads of 1.9 N and 4.9 N. It was attributed to occurrence of graphitisation and formation of transfer layer on alumina ball. {\textcopyright} 2008 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

Two main inter-related strands are emphasized. One is the continuing move down the length scale in terms of the fundamental understanding of tribological contacts. This has been particularly useful in aiding the development of new coatings by identifying their property requirements at different scale levels. A second strand relates to the ongoing imperative to be able to design and select coatings to meet practical friction and wear requirements. This selection problem requires a robust methodology, and one such is elaborated in the paper, which takes account of the requirements of different types of tribological contacts and uses a combination of theoretical and empirical information. Challenges still remain in this regard, and the paper seeks to provide a basis for further developments to improve coatings and to ensure their effective selection.},

abstract = {Body fluids and relative motion between implant and bone lead to synergistic degradation reactions, which cause failed implantation or adverse tissue reactions for implant materials used in human body. Because of their good chemical biocompatibility as well as acceptable mechanical properties, titanium (CP Ti) and its alloys are widely used in implant applications. ??-type Ti alloys including alloying elements such as Nb, Zr and Mo have become more popular among the extensively used ??- and (??+. ??)-type Ti alloys due to their low elastic modulus, comparable mechanical properties and high biocompatibility. This paper was mainly aimed to investigate the electrochemical and tribological properties of ??-type Ti alloys. Also, traditionally used ??-type Ti (??- CP Ti) and (??+. ??) type Ti-6Al-4V (??/. ??- Ti64) alloys were included for comparing the same set of the results. The XRD and SEM investigations and hardness measurements were utilized to analyze the structure, surface morphology and mechanical behavior of the alloys. Simulated body fluid (SBF) was used as corrosive environment. Tribocorrosion tests were carried out at open circuit potential (OCP), cathodic and three different anodic potentials under reciprocating sliding condition. Potentiodynamic scans were obtained with and without wear test. Friction coefficient, current density and volume loss were measured and calculated. The relative motion accelerated the material loss in corrosive environment due to the combined effect of electrochemical reaction and tribological action. All Ti alloys had almost the same sensitivity to the potentiodynamic corrosion. The ratio of depassivation/repassivation affected wear performance of titanium and its alloys during tribocorrosion tests. The rate of chemical reaction was higher in ??-type Ti-15Mo (??- Ti15) and Ti-45Nb (??- Ti45) alloys as compared to others. The (??+. ??) type Ti-6Al-4V (??/. ??- Ti64) and ?? type Ti-13Nb-13Zr (??- Ti1313) showed lower volume loss and lower friction coefficient values during tribocorrosion tests than others. The corrosion resistance of the ??- Ti64 alloy exhibited better corrosion resistance than ??- Ti1313 alloy. However, considering the implants applications, the ??- Ti1313 alloy may be a good candidate with relatively low elastic modulus and without toxic alloying elements.},

abstract = {The fretting behaviour of high speed steel SC 6-5-2 uncoated and coated with a TiN coating against an alumina ball was studied based on a fretting map approach. Cracking and material loss were observed depending on the contact loading. To quantify the damage, a methodology is proposed based on an elastic Hertzian-Mindlin contact description. The sliding regimes are clearly defined, applying some fretting sliding criteria. First appearing under partial slip conditions, the crack nucleation conditions were precisely identified for different number of cycles and normal forces. Comparison with various fatigue approaches indicates that, if the local friction coefficient as well as the local aspect of contact stressing are considered, the maximum principal and the equivalent Von Mises stresses permit a rather good quantification of cracking. Wear and debris formation mainly observed under gross slip conditions lead to a wear volume which is shown to present a linear evolution with the cumulated dissipated energy. This interfacial work approach is completed by a local description. Axial and lateral sliding axis linear energies are deduced allowing a rapid identification of the wear behaviour through different energy wear factors. Experimental comparison of the TiN coating with the steel substrate contact shows that, as long as the coating is present in the contact, the important compressive residual stresses prevent cracking whereas the energy wear analysis indicates a wear resistance of the coating up to 10 times superior to the studied steel.},

In this work DLC coatings on steel for tribological applications were developed. DLC was deposited on stainless steel (DIN 1.4305) by pulsed laser ablation of graphite. Generally the adhesion of DLC on steel was very poor. By applying different metallic interface layers (e.g. Cr, Mo, Si, Cu), the adhesion has been improved considerably. The microstructure of the interfaces has been studied by cross-sectional transmission electron microscopy, including high resolution imaging and electron diffraction, but no evidence for a crystalline reaction zone was observed. The adhesion of the coating has been tested by ultrasonic cavitation and the scratch test. A rank order of intermediate layer metal combinations was established.

abstract = {Both fretting wear and fretting fatigue suffer from particle detachment and cracking induced damage. Wear induced by fretting is related to a three-stage phenomenon: (1) accommodation of the displacement in the upper layers of the two counterbodies; (2) detachment of particles from material with a modified or transformed structure; and (3) third-body behaviour, i.e. accommodation of the velocity in the powder bed. The specific transformed structure from which debris is made is called the tribologically transformed structure or TTS. TTS has been shown to form in the first accommodation stage within a very few initial fretting cycles. Understanding of its formation and degradation are required to control and predict wear generated by fretting. Extensive studies focussed on the nature of TTSs depending on several metallic contacts (steels, aluminium alloys, $\alpha$-, $\beta$-, or $\alpha$+$\beta$-titanium alloys,{\ldots}) and different testing conditions (load, sliding amplitude, number of cycles, environment). Powerful analytical tools were utilized to determine the TTS composition and structure. TTS appeared as a nanocrystalline structure, corresponding to the chemical composition of the initial material and made of the more stable structure in accordance with the equilibrium diagram. No specific effects of oxygen or hydrogen was detected. In the present article, experimental results will be discussed to point out possible mechanisms of the formation of the TTS. An analogy with butterflies which form under rolling fatigue will be outlined. At last, an energy approach to explain formation will be presented for the case of low-alloy steel. It is demonstrated that TTS formation is related to a critical cumulative plastic deformation associated with a specific threshold dissipated energy.},

abstract = {The crack resistance of three different PVD coatings, TiN, Ti(C,N), and a multilayer system of alternating TiN and TiAlN, have been investigated. The three coating systems were deposited onto substrates with a different surface roughness to study the influence of this pretreatment on the crack resistance of the coatings. First, the microstructure and state of stress of the three PVD systems were detd. using X-ray diffraction and SEM. Then the coatings are loaded in tension in an ESEM to carry out in situ bending expts., to assess the crack resistance of the layers. Studying the results of the bending expts. in relation to the characteristic properties of the coatings shows that the compressive residual stresses have a large influence on the moment the first cracks arise. After the initiation of the first crack, the crack resistance of TiN, deposited on the smoothest substrate, is much better than that of TiN/TiAlN and Ti(C,N). Increasing the interface roughness for the Ti(C,N) and the TiN/TiAlN results in an increased crack resistance. For the coatings deposited on the roughest substrates, the crack resistance is, approx., the same for the three different systems. Spallation of the coatings also has been obsd. but does not occur frequently.},

The effect of substrate negative bias voltages on the impact property of the CrAlN coatings was studied. The X-ray diffraction (XRD) data show that all CrAlN coatings were crystallized in the cubic NaCl B1 structure, with the (1 1 1), (2 0 0) (2 2 0) and (2 2 2) diffraction peaks observed. Two-dimensional surface morphologies of CrAlN coatings were investigated by atomic force microscope (AFM). The results show that with increasing substrate bias voltage the coatings became more compact and denser, and the microhardness and fracture toughness of the coatings increased correspondingly. In the dynamic impact resistance tests, the CrAlN coatings displayed better impact resistance with the increase of bias voltage, due to the reduced emergence and propagation of the cracks in coatings with a very dense structure and the increase of hardness and fracture toughness in coatings. {\textcopyright} 2008 Elsevier B.V.

abstract = {Experiments have been carried out, using a tension-compression hydraulic machine, to investigate the fretting behavior of TiN coatings on high speed steel (HSS) against an alumina ball. In the experiments reported here, a range of different normal loads, displacement amplitudes and frequencies was used and the relative humidity of the test atmosphere was held at 5{\%} (RH), 25{\%} (RH), 50{\%} (RH), 75{\%} (RH) and 98{\%} (RH). Compared to uncoated HSS, the fretting maps were modified due to differences in the surface nature and to mechanical properties. With the exception of low relative humidity, the relative motion between TiN and alumina occurs under a gross slip regime and the shape of the friction force versus displacement loop is quasi-rectangular. In the 5{\%} RH and 25{\%} RH atmospheres, the relative motion between TiN and alumina went from partial slip to gross slip when increasing the displacement. All the curves showing the friction coefficient were characterised by an initial transient state where the friction coefficient increased rapidly, followed by a steady state. The coefficient of friction and the wear depth change with the experimental parameters due to different wear mechanisms.},

Films deposited with carbon beams in the range 1-100 eV reproduce the energy dependence of the biaxial stress, density and tetrahedral bonding fraction observed experimentally. The transition from low-density, graphite-like amorphous carbon to the high-density tetrahedral phase occurs at an energy at which impacting ions do not penetrate the surface of the film. This result is incompatible with the generally accepted subplantation explanation for the diamond-like properties, and a new model of energetic burial is deduced from the simulations. Radial distribution functions compare well with experiment, and represent a significant improvement over Tersoff and Brenner simulations which contain unphysical distances. {\textcopyright} 2005 Elsevier B.V.

abstract = {Improving the tribological functionality of diamondlike carbon (DLC) films-developing good wear resistance, low friction, and high load-carrying capacity-was the aim of this investigation. Nanocomposite coatings consisting of an amorphous DLC (a-DLC) top layer and a functionally graded titanium-titanium carbide-diamondlike carbon (Ti-TixCy-DLC) underlayer were produced on AISI 440C stainless steel substrates by the hybrid technique of magnetron sputtering and pulsed-laser deposition. The resultant DLC films were characterized by Raman spectroscopy, scanning electron microscopy, and surface profilometry. Two types of wear experiment were conducted in this investigation: sliding friction experiments and fretting wear experiments. Unidirectional ball-on-disk sliding friction experiments were conducted to examine the wear behavior of an a-DLC/Ti-TixCy-DLC-coated AISI 440C stainless steel disk in sliding contact with a 6-mm diameter AISI 440C stainless steel ball in ultrahigh vacuum, in dry nitrogen, and in humid air. Although the wear rates for both the coating and ball were low in all three environments, the humid air and dry nitrogen caused mild wear with burnishing in the a-DLC top layer, and the ultrahigh vacuum caused relatively severe wear with brittle fracture in both the a-DLC top layer and the Ti-TixCy-DLC underlayer. For reference, amorphous hydrogenated carbon (H-DLC) films produced on a-DLC/Ti-TixCy-DLC nanocomposite coatings by using an ion beam were also examined in the same manner. The H-DLC films markedly reduced friction even in ultrahigh vacuum without sacrificing wear resistibility. The H-DLC films behaved much like the a-DLC/Ti-TixCy-DLC nanocomposite coating in dry nitrogen and humid air, presenting low friction and low wear. Fretting wear experiments were conducted in humid air (approximately 50{\%} relative humidity) at a frequency of 80 Hz and an amplitude of 75 $\mu$m on an a-DLC/Ti-TixCy-DLC-coated AISI 440C disk and on a titanium-6 wt.{\%} aluminum-4 wt.{\%} vanadium (Ti-6A1-4V) flat, both in contact with a 9.4-mm diameter, hemispherical Ti-6Al-4V pin. The resistance to fretting wear and damage of the a-DLC/Ti-6Al-4V materials pair was superior to that of the Ti-6Al-4V/Ti-6A1-4V materials pair. {\textcopyright} 1999 Published by Elsevier Science S.A.},

abstract = {A comprehensive study of the mechanical properties of TiAlN and AlCrN coated cutting tools has been performed at room and elevated temperatures (up to 500 °C) using Micro Material's NanoTest Platform System. Micro-mechanical properties have been measured such as microhardness, elastic modulus, H/E ratio, microhardness dissipation parameter (MDP), critical load values (Lc1-first crack event; Lc2-load of dramatic coating failure) during scratch testing; a scratch crack propagation resistance parameter, CPRs = Lc1(Lc2 - Lc1) as well as nano-impact fracture resistance. Cutting tool life was studied under end milling conditions of the structural AISI 1040 steel. A correlation between CPRs was found with H/E ratio and MDP values. These parameters could be used to characterize the fracture toughness of the coatings. It was shown that mechanical characteristics such as H/E ratio, MDP and CPRs as well as nano-impact fracture resistance can be used to assess the resistance to adhesive-fatigue wear that is typical for end milling conditions. It was found that the microhardness of the coating and the H/E ratio reduces with rising temperature while the MDP value grows. The data obtained during quick laboratory nanohardness, nanoscratch as well as nano-impact fatigue testing can be used to rank the coatings studied and in some cases predict the relative life of a coated tool. {\textcopyright} 2005 Elsevier B.V.

abstract = {Micro-indentation test was performed for passive iron surface in deaerated pH 8.4 borate solution to correlate the passive film breakdown with mechanical deformation of substrate. Loading and unloading of a conical micro-indenter to the passive surface were repeated 10 times at an identical position. Elastic-plastic deformation occurred during the first indentation, while elastic deformation is predominant during the second and following indentations. The anodic current appears at the commencement of the first loading, with the maximum current generated at the maximum load. A more obvious current peak appears when the indenter just lost the contact with the iron surface during the first unloading. The current peaks observed during the subsequent indentations decreased markedly compared with the first indentation. Thus, the passive film breakdown by elastic deformation of iron substrate is less significant compared with that by plastic deformation under the present conditions. There is a linear correlation between the electric charge required for repassivation of the ruptured passive film and the work for plastic deformation. {\textcopyright} 2007 Elsevier B.V.

abstract = {Magnesium and its alloys have excellent physical and mechanical properties for a number of applications. In particular its high strength:weight ratio makes it an ideal metal for automotive and aerospace applications, where weight reduction is of significant concern. Unfortunately, magnesium and its alloys are highly susceptible to corrosion, particularly in salt-spray conditions. This has limited its use in the automotive and aerospace industries, where exposure to harsh service conditions is unavoidable. The simplest way to avoid corrosion is to coat the magnesium-based substrate to prevent contact with the environment. This review details the state of the art in coating and surface modification technologies, applied to magnesium based substrates for improved corrosion and wear resistance. The topics covered include electrochemical plating, conversion coatings, anodizing, gas-phase deposition processes, laser surface alloying/cladding and organic coatings.

abstract = {Fretting is associated to small displacement amplitudes between two contacting surfaces subjected to vibrations. Depending on the contact loading (normal force, displacement amplitude...), different sliding regimes may arise: partial slip, mixed slip and gross slip. In this paper, the fretting behaviour of Ti-6Al-4V titanium alloy contact has been investigated. Sliding regimes are clearly defined through the analysis of the evolutions of an energy sliding ratio and the tangential force ratio. To accurately determine the sliding regime transition, a new criterion is introduced. It is defined as the proportion of gross slip cycles during the test ({\%}GS). Fretting damage is also investigated though the analysis of crack lengths and wear volumes, compared to the sliding regime. The results show the relevance of this new sliding criterion to quantify the transition between partial, mixed and gross slip regimes. By comparing the values of this criterion and damage mechanisms, three steps have been defined in the competition between cracking and wear in the mixed slip regime. The first relates to a critical increase in cracks lengths, the second to a reduction of crack depths and the formation of a third body in the contact without ejection, and the last to the onset of wear by material removal. {\textcopyright} 2010 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract = {In order to characterize the adherence of DLC coatings (Diamond Like Carbon), scratch testing was performed on a unit equipped with sensors for normal and tangential forces, and an acoustic detector to detect the nucleation and the propagation of cracks. The system is also equipped with a microscope permitting observation of each event on the scratch according to the friction tangential force signal or the acoustic signal. The local microscopic observation allows identification of the damage with respect to the normal load. The test was performed with a Rockwell C indenter at the relative displacement speed, v=10 mm/min under a progressive normal load from 5 to 55 N. Coating failure appears in various modes, particularly the following: propagation of the cracks along the longitudinal edges of the scratch; propagation in front of the indenter; rupture along the maximum principal stress lines; and, detachment in the subsurface by shearing of the coating. The microscopic analysis of the evolution of the scratch under a progressive normal load permits identification of the various traces and the damage mechanisms of the coating. In this study, experimental results are shown for the scratch tests on bulk glass and DLC coating. Various modes of crack initiation, damage and rupture of these materials according to the critical normal load are presented. The analysis of the contact stress field distribution in bulk glass enables identification of the crack initiation and its propagation in the coating. {\textcopyright} 2005 Elsevier Ltd.

abstract = {In the case of surface coatings application it is crucial to establish when the substrate is reached to prevent catastrophic consequences. In this study, a model based on local dissipated energy is developed and related to the friction process. Indeed, the friction dissipated energy is a unique parameter that takes into account the major loading variables which are the pressure, sliding distance and the friction coefficient. To illustrate the approach a sphere/plane (Alumina/TiC) contact is studied under gross slip fretting regime. Considering the contact area extension, the wear depth evolution can be predicted from the cumulated dissipated energy density. Nevertheless, some difference is observed between the predicted and detected surface coating endurance. This has been explained by a coating spalling phenomenon observed below a critical residual coating thickness. Introducing an effective wear coating parameter, the coating endurance is better quantified and finally an effective energy density threshold, associated to a friction energy capacity approach, is introduced to rationalize the coating endurance prediction. The surface treatment lifetime is then simply deduced from an energy ratio between this specific energy capacity and a mean energy density dissipated per fretting cycle. The stability of this approach has been validated under constant and variable sliding conditions and illustrated through an Energy Density-Coating Endurance chart. {\textcopyright} 2004 Elsevier Ltd.

The nano-impact test has been shown to be effective at highlighting differences in resistance to contact damage in thin hard carbon coatings deposited on hardened steel. A novel micro-scale rapid impact test capability capable of producing repetitive impacts at significantly higher strain rate and energy than in the nano-impact test has been developed recently enabling the study of coating fatigue with less sharp spherical indenters than in the nano-impact test. Results with the new micro-impact technique on two commercial hard carbon coatings (Graphit-iC and Dymon-iC from Teer Coatings) on tool steel are presented. The role of coating mechanical properties on the fatigue resistance and the load-sensitivity of the impact failure mechanism is discussed. The harder coating with higher sp 3 /sp 2 bonded C (Dymon-iC) was found to be significantly less durable under fatigue loading than the softer Graphit-iC. Reasons for the observed differences are discussed.},

abstract = {Electron energy-loss spectroscopy (EELS) has been used to analyze the structure of hydrogenated diamond-like carbon (DLC) films deposited by plasma-assisted CVD (PACVD) under a variety of conditions. Spectra obtained from highly oriented pyrolytic graphite and amorphous carbon were used as references. The ratio sp3(tetragonal) to sp2(trigonal) carbon sites in the DLC films was quantified for different hydrogen contents from the near-edge structure (ELNES) of the carbon K-edge and compared with a constrained network structure model. The results were in agreement with this model and showed an increase of the ratio sp3to sp2with increasing hydrogen content in the material. The irradiation damage caused by the electron beam increased the sp2fraction even when using a N2-cooled specimen holder. In order to better identify the chemical bonding from the carbon K near-edge structure, the first two peaks of the edge were deconvoluted to obtain the peaks of individual transitions, after subtracting the simulation of the carbon K-edge continuum to extract the core-excitation peaks. The relative contributions of 1s/$\pi$ *(C=C), 1s/$\sigma$ *(C-H) and 1s/$\sigma$ *(C-C) were thus obtained. The position in energy of each peak is discussed. {\textcopyright} 1998 Published by Elsevier Science S.A.},

The approach involves solving the micro-contact models and separation formulas simultaneously. Comparison of different contact models reveals that the use of elastic-plastic micro-contact models predicts a lower maximum normal pressure and a greater contact width and real contact area compared to the GW model.

High rates are defined as those sufficient to deposit thick films in a reasonable time. To avoid superficiality, this review is restricted to evaporation and sputtering, i.e. to physical vapor deposition (PVD). PVD is finding increased use for applications ranging from micro? electronics to corrosion-barrier and wear-resistant coatings, and to the synthesis of free-standing shapes with unique mechanical properties. The emphasis here is on metallic deposits and on the physics of their growth and structure. Particular attention is given to sputtering, because recent developments ih sputtering tech? nology make thick film deposition feasible, and because the subject has not been reviewed. Several reviews have concentrated on thick film deposition by evaporation (1, 2). Structure zone models (3-5) [particularly the model proposed by Movchan {\&} Demchishin (3), which predicts three structural forms or zones as a function of T/Tm. where T is the substrate temperature and Tm is the coating-material melting point] have come into increased use in inter preting coating microstructures. There? fore this review is organized from thc viewpoint of the zone models. After a brief survey of certain pertinent features of evaporation and sputtering, subsequent sections discuss each of the structural zones, metallurgical phase formation, and the mechanical properties of coatings. In this review the structure zones are defined in terms of dominant physical processes rather than structural forms. This generalization permits a broader correlation with experimental observations.},

Different type of parameters and simulation methods are used to describe the surface roughness.

Limitations of this methods lead to use the concept of self-similar fractals to model the rough surface through Mandelbrot-Weierstrass function. It is difficult to express surface roughness as a function of process parameters in the form of analytical functions. Method based on neural networks has been used to model these surfaces to map the process parameters to roughness parameters.

abstract = {Diamond like carbon (DLC) coatings have been proven to be an excellent choice for wear reduction in many technical applications. However, for successful adaption to the orthopaedic field, layer performance, stability and adhesion in physiologically relevant setups are crucial and not consistently investigated. In vitro wear testing as well as adequate corrosion tests of interfaces and interlayers are of great importance to verify the long term stability of DLC coated load bearing implants in the human body. DLC coatings were deposited on articulating lumbar spinal disks made of CoCr28Mo6 biomedical implant alloy using a plasma-activated chemical vapor deposition (PACVD) process. As an adhesion promoting interlayer, tantalum films were deposited by magnetron sputtering. Wear tests of coated and uncoated implants were performed in physiological solution up to a maximum of 101 million articulation cycles with an amplitude of ±2° and -3/+6° in successive intervals at a preload of 1200 N. The implants were characterized by gravimetry, inductively coupled plasma optical emission spectrometry (ICP-OES) and cross section scanning electron microscopy (SEM) analysis. It is shown that DLC coated surfaces with uncontaminated tantalum interlayers perform very well and no corrosive or mechanical failure could be observed. This also holds true in tests featuring overload and third-body wear by cortical bone chips present in the bearing pairs. Regarding the interlayer tolerance towards interlayer contamination (oxygen), limits for initiation of potential failure modes were established. It was found that mechanical failure is the most critical aspect and this mode is hypothetically linked to the $\alpha$-$\beta$ tantalum phase switch induced by increasing oxygen levels as observed by X-ray diffraction (XRD). It is concluded that DLC coatings are a feasible candidate for near zero wear articulations on implants, potentially even surpassing the performance of ceramic vs. ceramic.},

abstract = {Owing to its superior tribological and mechanical properties with corrosion resistance, biocompatibility, and hemocompatibility, diamond-like carbon (DLC) has emerged as a promising material for biomedical applications. DLC films with various atomic bond structures and compositions are finding places in orthopedic, cardiovascular, and dental applications. Cells grew on to DLC coating without any cytotoxity and inflammation. DLC coatings in orthopedic applications reduced wear, corrosion, and debris formation. DLC coating also reduced thrombogenicity by minimizing the platelet adhesion and activation. However, some contradictory results (Airoldi et al., Am J Cardiol 2004;93:474–477, Taeger et al., Mat-wiss u Werkstofftech 2003;34:1094–1100) were also reported that no significant improvement was observed in the performance of DLC-coated stainless stent or DLC-coated femoral head. This controversy should be discussed based on the detailed information of the coating such as atomic bond structure, composition, and/or electronic structure. In addition, instability of the DLC coating caused by its high level of residual stress and poor adhesion in aqueous environment should be carefully considered. Further in vitro and in vivo studies are thus required to confirm its use for medical devices. {\textcopyright} 2007 Wiley Periodicals, Inc. J Biomed Mater Res Part B: Appl Biomater, 2007},

abstract = {Understanding sliding and load-bearing mechanisms of biphasic soft matter is crucial for designing synthetic replacements of cartilage, contact-lens materials or coatings for medical instruments. Interstitial fluid pressurization is believed to be the intrinsic load-carrying phenomenon governing the frictional properties. In this study, we have characterized permeability and identified the fluid contribution to the support of load during Atomic Force Microscopy (AFM) nanoindentation of soft polymer brushes in aqueous environments, by means of the Proper Generalized Decomposition (PGD) approach. First, rate-dependent AFM nanoindentation was performed on a poly(acrylamide) (PAAm) brush in an aqueous environment, to probe the purely elastic as well as poro-viscoelastic properties. Second, a biphasic model decoupling the fluid and solid load contributions was proposed, using Darcy's equation for liquid flow in porous media. Using realistic time-dependent simulations requires many direct solutions of the 3D partial differential equation, making modeling very time-consuming. To efficiently alleviate the time-consumption of multi-dimensional modeling, we used PGD to solve a Darcy model defined in a 7D domain, considering all the unknowns and material properties as extra coordinates of the problem. The obtained 7D simulation results were compared to the experimental results by using a direct Newton algorithm, since all sensitivities with respect to the model parameters are readily available. Thus, a simulation-based solution for depth- and rate-dependent permeability can be obtained. From the PGD-based model permeability is calculated, and the velocity- and pressure-fields in the material can be obtained in real-time in 3D by adjusting the parameters to the experimental values. The result is a step forward in understanding the fluid flow, permeability and fluid contributions to the load support of biphasic soft matter.},

abstract = {Recently, multicomponent CrAlSiN and TiAlSiN coatings have been developed in order to gain high hardness and good thermal stability. In this study, the influence of TiAlN, CrAlSiN and TiAlSiN coatings on the wear behavior and cutting performance of the carbide cutting tools was investigated in dry machining of a Ti-6Al-4V alloy. TiAlN, CrAlSiN and TiAlSiN coatings were deposited on tungsten carbide milling inserts by using cathodic arc evaporation. The deposited TiAlN, CrAlSiN and TiAlSiN possess high hardness of 31. ±. 1. GPa, 36. ±. 2 and 35. ±. 2. GPa, respectively. After annealing at 700. °C in air, the hardness of the CrAlSiN and TiAlSiN still keeps as high as 35-36. GPa, while the hardness of TiAlN decreases to 26. GPa. The main wear modes for the TiAlSiN-, TiAlN coated- and uncoated tools are abrasion and adhesion. The nanocrystalline TiAlSiN coatings retard the tool wear as compared to the TiAlN-coated tools. At a high cutting speed of 350. m/min, the tool life of the CrAlSiN coatings exceeds the TiAlSiN-, and TiAlN-coated and uncoated tools by 2.9, 4.2 and 9.5 times, respectively. The CrAlSiN coatings show high wear resistances in dry machining of Ti-6Al-4V alloys, and thus possess the best cutting performance.},

abstract = {Hardness has typically been defined as the resistance of a material to permanent penetration by another harder material. The results obtained when performing Rockwell, Vickers, and Brinell tests are determined after the test force has been removed. Therefore, the effect of elastic deformation under the indenter has been ignored. ISO 14577 (all parts) has been prepared to enable the user to evaluate the indentation of materials by considering both the force and displacement during plastic and elastic deformation. By monitoring the complete cycle of increasing and removal of the test force, hardness values equivalent to traditional hardness values can be determined. More significantly, additional properties of the material, such as its indentation modulus and elasto-plastic hardness, can also be determined. All these values can be calculated without the need to measure the indent optically. Furthermore, by a variety of techniques, the instrumented indentation test allows to record hardness and modulus depth profiles within a, probably complex, indentation cycle. ISO 14577 (all parts) has been written to allow a wide variety of post-test data analysis.},

Serial section techniques, previously the domain of specialists, are becoming increasingly automated with the development of systems such as the automatic tape-collecting ultramicrotome, and serial blockface and focused ion beam scanning electron microscopes. These changes are rapidly broadening the scope of biomedical studies to which volume electron microscopy techniques can be applied beyond the brain. Further innovations in microscope design are also in the pipeline, which have the potential to enhance the speed and quality of data collection. The recent introduction of integrated light and electron microscopy systems will revolutionise correlative light and volume electron microscopy studies, by enabling the sequential collection of data from light and electron imaging modalities without intermediate specimen manipulation. In doing so, the acquisition of comprehensive functional information and direct correlation with ultrastructural details within a 3-dimensional reference space will become routine. The prospects for volume electron microscopy are therefore bright, and the stage is set for a challenging and exciting future. {\textcopyright} 2014 The Authors.},

abstract = {Friction and wear minimizing coatings are crucial for applications in combustion engines and medical implants. Their performance is typically limited by mechanical failure especially due to local overload. In this work, the contact damage creation, evolution, and final morphology of hydrogenated diamond-like carbon (DLC)-coated titanium (Ti) substrates are investigated. The influence of the DLC film thickness and the elastic–plastic deformation of the Ti on the contact damage are studied by microindentation and static finite-element analysis. Film thickness, indenter radius, and applied load as well as the elastic–plastic deformation of the Ti are shown to significantly affect contact damage. A failure plot is presented with the location of first failure in the DLC and compared to the experimental observation. In addition, a case study with variable fracture toughness of the DLC and its influence on the failure plot is shown. The stress distribution in the DLC follows a transition from a membrane-like to a plate-like deformation behavior upon increasing the DLC film thickness. Thin DLC films reveal increased cracking in the inner zone of the indent, while thicker DLC films reveal pronounced edge cracking. These edge cracks were correlated to pop-ins in force–displacement curves upon microindentation. Finally, a film thickness optimization process is presented for hard and brittle films on soft and ductile metallic substrates.},

abstract = {Thin films and coatings can fail by fatigue at lower loads than predicted by static tests. The nano-impact technique is a low load impact test capable of revealing marked differences in performance that can be used to optimize the design of coating systems for improved durability. Instead of simply "characterizing" coatings and thin films, their actual tribological performance under "in-service" conditions can now be assessed. The technique can be used to find the optimum coating process parameters for enhanced toughness and damage tolerance and can also differentiate between cohesive (chipping) and adhesive failure (delamination). This paper introduces the concepts behind the nano-impact technique and presents results on compositionally graded a-C:H, a-C and CrAlTiN coatings on tool steel. The performance of the CrAlTiN system was dependent on the impact load. The a-C showed greatly improved impact resistance compared to the a-C:H coating due to its graphite-like structure. {\textcopyright} 2004 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

abstract = {Nanoindentation is a powerful technique used for assessing mechanical properties at nano/micro-scale. It is used for obtaining material parameters like elastic modulus, hardness, plastic or viscous parameters from experimental readings of indenter load and depth of penetration. Forces involved are usually in the milli or micronewton range and the depth in the order of nanometers. Different kinds of probes can be used for making an imprint into the material surface. Very small material volumes having the order of several tens of nanometers can be accessed with the tip of the nanoindenter and material properties can be evaluated for such a small piece of the materials. Nanoindentation finds application in extracting the elastic and plastic properties of the indented material surface. The effective knowledge of the indenter tip geometry is significant in nanoindentation experimental analysis. A small deviation from the ideal tip geometry affects the accuracy of the result during nanoindentation experiments. In the present investigation, we have studied the influence of tip radius of the indenter on the hardness of for different indenter shapes such as spherical, conical and Berkovich.},

The films can be prepared at low temperatures by different techniques using a large variety of precursors and can be modified by incorporation of different elements such as N, F, Si or metals. The diversity of methods used for the deposition of diamond-like carbon films provides the flexibility to tailor their properties according to specific needs and potential applications. The hydrogenated form of DLC appears to reach a maturity in understanding its properties and finding old and new practical applications for it. The non-hydrogenated diamond-like carbon, or tetrahedral carbon, is at a much younger state of preparation and characterization and practical applications have yet to be proven. The paper will review the state of the art of the preparation of the different types of diamond-like carbon films, the characterization and understanding of their properties, and their practical applications.},

For these configurations of the magnetrons, the dependencies of the discharge voltage, substrate ion current density, deposition rate, minimal working pressure on MSS geometrical unbalance (KG) were received. Based on the data obtained it was determined that for all MSS, independent of the dimensions of magnetic system, the magnetic field of balanced configuration is formed at KG = 1.235–1.27, and the discharge voltage has maximal conductivity. If KG is decreased the magnetic field with unbalanced configuration of second type is formed, at greater KG the magnetic field of the first type is developed. For all investigated configurations of the magnetrons the minimal working pressure can be reached at a lower level of the geometric unbalance (KG = 1.02–1.125) compared to the minimal discharge voltage, and it is independent of the dimensions of magnetron's magnetic system.},

abstract = {Hardness has typically been defined as the resistance of a material to permanent penetration by another harder material. The results obtained when performing Rockwell, Vickers, and Brinell tests are determined after the test force has been removed. Therefore, the effect of elastic deformation under the indenter has been ignored. ISO 14577 (all parts) has been prepared to enable the user to evaluate the indentation of materials by considering both the force and displacement during plastic and elastic deformation. By monitoring the complete cycle of increasing and removal of the test force, hardness values equivalent to traditional hardness values can be determined. More significantly, additional properties of the material, such as its indentation modulus and elasto-plastic hardness, can also be determined. All these values can be calculated without the need to measure the indent optically. Furthermore, by a variety of techniques, the instrumented indentation test allows to record hardness and modulus depth profiles within a, probably complex, indentation cycle. ISO 14577 (all parts) has been written to allow a wide variety of post-test data analysis.},

abstract = {Fretting damages are connected to numerous aspects like friction, wear, contact mechanics, fatigue and material sciences. Its quantification also requests to consider the loading history as well as the sliding condition. Based on a "fretting sliding" approach, and considering fretting wear test conditions, various palliative solutions have been investigated. Shot peening treatment, introducing compressive residual stresses, appears pertinent against crack propagation but ineffective against crack nucleation due to the activation of surface relaxation phenomena. Hard thin coatings present stable residual stresses independently of the sliding conditions. However, they only delay the crack nucleation process, when the coating is worn through, cracking phenomena are activated. To quantify the coating endurance against wear, an energy density approach has been developed. The stability of this approach has been confirmed regarding the contact size effect and illustrated through the analysis of synergic interaction between soft thick coating and solid lubricant. {\textcopyright} 2006 Elsevier Ltd.

abstract = {Various components need protection against superimposed corrosion and wear (abrasion, erosion) loading, e.g. in off-shore applications. The goal of the research has been to develop a PVD multilayer coating by systematically altering the layer architecture in order to protect components against corrosive environments and erosive loadings. Our approach regarding the coating architecture has been to apply a diamond-like carbon (DLC) layer on top of a multilayer coating system, to ensure an excellent erosion resistance while providing a good corrosion protection.Our investigation is focused on the influence of the application technology (PVD or PECVD) and the resulting coating properties of the DLC top-layer. The investigated PECVD-top-layer was produced by a mixture of acetylene and hydrogen gas, whereas the PVD-top-layers were deposited from a graphite-target and different mixtures of acetylene and argon gas. The applicated DLC top-layers are characterized by hardness values between 11 and 23. GPa and similar adhesion properties. Note that hardness has been determined by nano-indentation and adhesion characterized by scratch testing. Residual stresses of the DLC-top-layers were determined by means of focused ion beam milling and tracking of the resulting relaxation strains by digital image correlation. Residual compressive stresses up to 2. GPa have been determined. Under loading in an erosive environment (combination of abrasive and fatigue loading) the abrasive degradation of the investigated coatings has been found to depend mainly on coating hardness. As expected, the hardest DLC top-layer (PECVD) shows least abrasive degradation. However, when tested under cyclic loading, the coating exhibiting the highest hardness values (PECVD) show the most severe fatigue damage of all DLC coatings investigated. {\textcopyright} 2013 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract = {In this study, we demonstrate the microstructure dependency of erosion behaviour of laser clad, detonation sprayed and atmospheric plasma sprayed chromium carbide based coatings. The final chromium carbide content in all the coatings was a strong function of rapid solidification rate associated with the processes. In the laser clad coating majority of the chromium carbides re-solidified while in the thermally sprayed coatings chromium carbide re-solidification was hindered to a large extent. Hence, the final chromium carbide content in the thermally sprayed coating decreased with increased extent of particle melting during spraying. Decarburisation and oxidation during thermal spraying lead to the formation of chromium carbides with lower carbon content and chromium oxide(s). Laser clad and detonation sprayed coatings, with higher chromium carbide content, showed lower erosion rates and exhibited fewer brittle erosion events. Embrittlement due to excessive dissolution of chromium carbides into the matrix and poor splat bonding were found to be the reasons for higher erosion rate of the plasma sprayed coating. Scanning electron microscopy and quantification of single erodent impact events clearly established ductile material removal in the laser clad and detonation sprayed coating and brittle material removal in the plasma sprayed coating as the dominant mechanism(s). A good agreement was found between solid particle erosion testing and nano impact testing results.},

abstract = {Soft, biphasic materials such as hydrogels are commonly used to mimic lubrication and confinement mechanics of biological tissue such as articular cartilage or the cornea. In-depth understanding of such mechanics is crucial for designing synthetic replacements for cartilage, contact-lens materials or soft coatings for medical devices. Using colloidal-probe atomic force microscopy (AFM), surfaces can be investigated at the nanoscale and information on the contact modulus, poro-viscoelastic properties and the permeability can be extracted. Yet, probing the surface of a soft material in a liquid environment is challenging, since the point of contact between a probe and sample surface during finite-rate indentation can be obscured by viscous squeeze-out effects of temporarily confined liquid. To address this issue, we have developed a 2-step indentation method that enables accurate alignment of finite-rate indentation curves with respect to the contact point of quasi-static indentation of soft matter in liquid. In this work, the issue and the method are illustrated by measurements on a commonly used poly(acrylamide) (PAAm) hydrogel. We have shown that liquid squeeze-out may cause non-negligible force offsets that can result in false contact-point determination during finite-rate indentation. The presented method allows accurate alignment of the indentation curves, enables one to accurately study the rate-dependent contact moduli and related stiffening effects, and thus greatly facilitates mechanical characterization of both biological as well as synthetic soft materials.},

abstract = {Fretting wear tests were performed on several aluminium alloys (2024, 2091, 7075) in air. The normal load ranged from 200 to 1000 N and the imposed displacement from ± 15 to ± 100 $\mu$m. The tangential force was recorded during each cycle of the fretting test and plotted as a function of the displacement (F-D cycle). Three kinds of F-D cycle were observed depending on the fretting conditions: the closed, elliptic and parallelepipedic cycle. Friction logs (i.e. a three-dimensional representation of the F-D cycles for a given test) are used to describe fretting regimes and fretting transitions. Optical examination of the superficial layers of the samples was performed after each fretting test to characterize the material response. Two degradation modes, cracking and particle detachment, were observed. They were achieved generally simultaneously but, depending on the fretting regime, one or the other was predominant when comparing the behaviour of the three alloys. Results of crack initiation and propagation were found to fit well the classical fatigue properties of the three aluminium alloys. Wear debris originated from the transformed layer, whatever the metal alloy. The results are discussed in term of fretting maps: a running conditions fretting map which describes the fretting regime vs. the fretting conditions (load and displacement), and a material response fretting map which allows one to define the domains of degradation (no degradation, cracking, particle detachment) vs. the fretting conditions. {\textcopyright} 1992.},

The results from several nanomechanical and tribological test techniques - nanoindentation, nano-scratch and nano-fretting (nano-wear) - can be used together to aid the design of DLC coating architectures for enhanced durability in specific applications. In this study the behaviour of multilayered DLC coatings (Cr/W-C:H/a-C:H, Cr/W-C:H/Si-a-C:H) was compared to that of CrN/a-C:H:W (WC/C). We have previously reported that in nano-wear tests the coating with the highest hardness and H/. E displayed greater wear resistance [T.W. Liskiewicz et al., Surf. Coat. Technol. 237 (2013) 212]. By employing nano- and micro-scale tribological testing with probes of differing sharpness it is possible to change the sensitivity of the test to probe the response of the coating top layer or the entire multilayer coating-substrate system. In the nano-scratch tests using a spherical indenter with a 5. ??m end radius the maximum stresses are located well within the top layer of the multilayer coatings and consequently the mechanical properties of this top layer dominate the nano-tribological behaviour. In the micro-scratch using a 25. ??m spherical probe the stress field extends further towards the sub-layers and steel substrate and consequently the behaviour is completely different. Under these conditions the coating with the lowest hardness and H/. E showed improved performance with higher critical loads for cracking and total coating failure. High resolution SEM imaging has been used to investigate this further. A simple contact model strongly suggests that cracking and failure events occur on the harder coatings when the maximum von Mises stress was located close to the interfaces in the multilayer systems.},

abstract = {The article attempts to bring up-to-date the known facts concerning the mechanism of fretting wear in metals with special reference to the common engineering materials iron and steel under normal conditions. The process can be divided into three stages, those of initial adhesion and metal transfer, the production of debris in a normally oxidised state and, finally, the steady-state wear condition. Once metallic contact is established, the ease of which is represented by the oxide-metal hardness ratio, the resultant adhesion coefficient reflects the subsurface deformation involved. Oxidation occurs as a direct result of mechanical deformation promoting free surface and internal defects favouring adsorption of gaseous oxygen followed, subsequently, by its dissociation. Abrasion as a cause of fretting damage is favoured only as a minor factor, the majority of damage being initiated in the initial stages and being reflected in the steady-state dispersal of debris. {\textcopyright} 1970.},

abstract = {Hydrogen-free amorphous carbon films produced by direct deposition of low energy carbon ions exhibit diamond-like properties such as extreme hardness, large band gap and high index of refraction. Using mass separated ion beam deposition, high purity diamond-like carbon (DLC) films were grown under vacuum conditions better than 10-5 Pa on Si substrates kept at room temperature. The deposition parameters such as the ion energy, vacuum conditions, substrate temperature and ion species can be controlled independently, and thus used to modify the film properties and composition. In this paper we present the first results of doping of DLC films during growth by alternating deposition of 100 eV 12C+ ions and dopant ions such as 63Cu+, 27Al+, 11B+ or 14N+. For beam currents of up to 100 $\mu$A cm-2, DLC films with a thickness of several micrometers were produced. Undoped films were characterized by Raman spectrometry, ellipsometry, electrical measurements, Rutherford backscattering spectrometry (RBS) and proton induced X-ray emission. For these films an energy gap of 2.6 eV, a Vickers hardness of 4500 kg mm-2, an index of refraction n {\textgreater} 2, a resistivity of 109 $\Omega$ cm and an electrical breakdown strength greater than 109 V m-1 were measured. Dopant concentration profiles of copper-doped films were analyzed by RBS. Homogeneous dopant concentrations of several atomic per cent are easily achieved. {\textcopyright} 1993.},

Depending on fretting and fatigue loading conditions, crack nucleation and possibly crack propagation can be activated. This paper proposes a procedure for estimating these two damage thresholds. The crack nucleation boundary is formalized by applying the Crossland high cycle fatigue criterion taking into account the stress gradient and the ensuing "size effect". The prediction of the crack propagation condition is formalized using a short crack arrest description. Applied to a AISI 1034 steel, this methodology allows the development of an original material response fretting-fatigue map, where the different material responses related to crack nucleation, crack arrest and catastrophic failure are established and formalized. {\textcopyright} 2008 Elsevier Ltd.

In this paper, ionic liquids (ILs) with low volatility and high environmental stability were investigated as lubricants for sliding MEMS devices. A method that is based on atomic force microscopy (AFM) with a liquid cell was developed to study friction and wear properties of surfaces lubricated with ILs, having a systematic variation in molecular geometry and chemistry. Six-member pyridinium and five-member imidazolium rings are compared as cations in ethyl methyl pyridinium and ethyl methyl imidazolium ethyl sulfate; influence of short and long alkyl chain lengths on lubrication is studied with butyl methyl pyrrolidinium and hexyl methyl pyrrolidinium bis(trifluro methyl sulfonyl) imide. Formation of a surface-screening cation layer was discovered and linked to low friction and wear of IL-lubricated hydrogenated-silicon (H-Si) substrates. Several promising IL lubricants were identified from the AFM study and were tested in real MEMS motor devices. The friction and wear data obtained for these tests showed good correlation with the failure life span of lubricated MEMS motors. This supports a conclusion that the AFM-liquid-cell technique can be used in screening IL lubricants for MEMS devices.},

The influence of conventional additives on the tribological performance of various types of DLC coatings is still poorly understood. This paper addresses the friction and wear performance of a non-hydrogenated DLC (a-C) coating as a function of additive chemistry. Tests were performed in a pin-on-plate tribometer under boundary lubrication conditions. Surface analyses were carried out using Atomic Force Microscopy (AFM), Scanning Electron Microscopy (SEM) and X-ray Photoelectron Spectroscopy (XPS). Results showed that the antiwear additive zinc dialkyldithiophosphate (ZDDP) provided excellent wear protection to a-C coating by forming zinc phosphate in the tribofilm. However, when friction modifier Moly Dimer (MD) or Moly Trimer (MT) was added with ZDDP, zinc phosphate was found to be absent, resulting in higher wear than ZDDP alone. Both friction modifiers decomposed and supplied MoS2 to the tribological interfaces. The transfer of the worn coating material, which was a function of the antiwear performance of additives, was shown to have an influence on friction performance. {\textcopyright} 2010 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract = {The scratch adhesion test appears to be a simple rapid method to assess qualitatively the adhesion of hard tribological coatings. Despite the widespread use of the technique, it is difficult to express adhesion in a quantitative way because the critical load is influenced by many factors such as substrate hardness, film thickness, interface bonding, and by several parameters related to the test condition. This paper considers the indenter radius effects on the scratch adhesion of TiN and CrN coatings deposited on metal substrates with different hardness by arc evaporation. The critical load varies with Rm, where R is indenter radius. The m index m for the present coatings slightly increased with substrate hardness from 1.16 to 1.20 for 2.2 $\mu$m TiN coatings and from 1.11 to 1.24 for 2.8 mm CrN coatings. The critical scratch depth for coating failure depends on only the extent of sample's deformation, not the substrate materials. The critical load also increased proportionally to the product of the scratch depth and the composite hardness at the critical load. These results suggest that the failure mode of the present coatings is mainly dominated by cohesive strength of deposited films. The scratch adhesion was analyzed from the point of view of the composite hardness of the coating-substrate system. The calculated critical load showed good agreement with the measured critical load of coated materials. The indenter radius effects on the scratch adhesion related to the plastic properties of the indicated coated materials corresponding to the scratch depth at the critical load. {\textcopyright} 2002 Elsevier Science B.V.

The maximum value of residual stress is reached at -100 V substrate bias coinciding with the biggest values of adhesion and nanohardness. Nanoindentation measurement proves that the force-depth curve shifts due to residual stress.

Mg alloys have the potential to enable design of lighter engineered systems, including positive implications for reduced energy consumption. Furthermore, Mg alloys are also emerging as viable biodegradable materials and battery electrodes. In spite of the greatest historical Mg usage at present, the wider use of Mg alloys remains restricted by a number of inherent limitations, including vulnerability to corrosion, poor formability and low creep resistance. This review covers recent research that has led to advances in Mg-alloy corrosion; including the application of contemporary methods for understanding Mg corrosion, the establishment of an electrochemical framework for Mg corrosion, illumination of alloying effects, and attempts at corrosion resistant Mg alloys. A discussion drawing from many sources provides an unbiased focus on new achievements, as well as some contentious issues in the field. The electrochemistry of Mg is reviewed in detail, including so-called anodic hydrogen evolution and cathodic activation. This review also covers atmospheric corrosion, and biodegradable Mg alloys. Finally, past and present trends in the field of Mg corrosion are reviewed, identifying knowledge gaps, whilst attempting to also identify future developments and directions.},

Nanoindentations on film surfaces, at various pressures micro-blasted, revealed the influence of the different micro-blasting grains on the coating superficial hardness. For investigating the effect of the developed film compressive stresses at certain micro-blasting pressures and grain qualities on the film's brittleness, nano-impact tests were conducted. Moreover, roughness and cutting edge geometry measurements were carried out via confocal microscopy and EDX microanalyses after micro-blasting by Al2O3 or ZrO2 grains for detecting potential film thickness decrease and substrate revelation. The wear behaviour of coated and variously micro-blasted tools was investigated in milling of hardened steel. The attained results provide insight concerning optimum selection of micro-blasting data in various grain cases, for improving the cutting performance of coated tools. {\textcopyright} 2011 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract = {ABSTRACTNanoindentation and nanoscratching experiments have been performed to assess the mechanical properties of several carbon thin films with potential application as wear resistant coatings for magnetic disks. These include three hydrogenated-carbon films prepared by sputter deposition in a H2/Ar gas mixture (hydrogen contents of 20, 34, and 40 atomic {\%}) and a pure carbon film prepared by cathodic-arc plasma techniques. Each film was deposited on a silicon substrate to thickness of about 300 nm. The hardness and elastic modulus were measured using nanoindentation methods, and ultra-low load scratch tests were used to assess the scratch resistance of the films and measure friction coefficients. The results show that the hardness, elastic modulus, and scratch resistance of the 20{\%} and 34{\%} hydrogenated films are significantly greater than the 40{\%} film, thereby showing that there is a limit to the amount of hydrogen producing beneficial effects. The cathodic-arc film, with a hardness of greater than 59 GPa, is considerably harder than any of the hydrogenated films and has a superior scratch resistance.},

abstract = {The design of anti-friction coatings able to perform well in different wear conditions without lubricants requires a combination of adequate hardness and toughness, good adhesion, a low friction coefficient and a low wear rate. Recently introduced metal-diamond like carbon (DLC) coatings produced by magnetron sputtering of metals from targets, which are to a controlled extent covered with carbon from the chamber atmosphere, can be a step towards the achievement of such a combination. These coatings consist of an amorphous a:CH matrix with the possible incorporation of metal (Ta, W, Nb, Ti), metal carbide and/or graphite grains. Previous studies of Tix{\%}-DLC coatings showed their good protective properties against abrasive, impact and single scratch wear, as well as a requirement for supporting interlayers to successfully apply such coatings to low-cost steels. In the present work an example of the selection of metal-ceramic Ti-TiN-TiCN supporting interlayers is given based on studies of their morphology, structure and mechanical properties. This resulted in the development of Ti-TiN-TiCN-[TiC-(Tix{\%}-DLC)] multilayer composite coatings. Several coatings were prepared with the same supporting interlayer and a variation in the preparation of the Tix{\%}-DLC layer. Ball-on-disc experiments were carried out to investigate these coatings in conditions of sliding wear against steel and cemented tungsten carbide balls. CrN, TiN and TiCN coatings were also deposited and tested in the same conditions to provide a reference. Low friction coefficients (below 0.2 at an air humidity of 50{\%} RH) in combination with low normalized wear rates were found for multilayer coatings with upper Ti20{\%}-DLC and Ti35{\%}-DLC layers.

The DLC nanocomposite films deposited by HMDS contained hollow spherical nanocrystallites, called nanoballs, of hexagonal silicon carbide. The nanocomposite films deposited by HMDSN contained crystalline Si3N4 nanoparticles. The nanocomposite films deposited by HMDSO contained amorphous SiOx nanoparticles. Although both types of films had similar hardness, the DLC nanocomposite films exhibited much lower compressive stresses than the DLC films deposited by methane, i.e., 1.5 vs 11 GPa, respectively.

abstract = {Ti-doped diamond-like carbon (Ti-doped DLC) films were deposited on 304 stainless steel through a pulsed filtered cathodic vacuum arc deposition with an individual cathodic arc source. Structural dependent thermal stability, mechanical properties, adhesion, and corrosion performance were thoroughly investigated as a function of the Ti content. Only 0.8 at.{\%} Ti content in the DLC films offers the relatively high hardness (28.8 GPa), high corrosion resistance, enhanced adhesion strength as well as improved thermal stability compared to the undoped DLC films. The reduction in the internal stress and the sp 3 content associated with a slight decrease in the mechanical properties is from Ti doping. Higher thermal stability is due to the TiC phase in the Ti-doped DLC structure. Enhancement of the adhesion strength is owing to the relief of the internal stress and the occurrence of the strong atomic intermixing bond at a Ti-doped DLC/Ti intermediate layer interface. Interestingly, the formation of the TiO 2 film on the Ti-doped DLC surface due to a small amount of Ti doping significantly exhibited a better corrosion performance. Ti-doped DLC films, therefore, are a promising coating for tribological applications.},

abstract = {Materials fail through overstressing and overstraining. Overstressing leads to crack initiation and later propagation which can cause failure. Overstraining leads to material transformation, for instance strain hardening, followed by changes in material properties such as toughness loss. This paper presents an overview of the work done in the last ten years on fretting, and illustrates these types of failure with respect to this particular form of damage. It divides the factors that govern overstressing and overstraining into three groups: the imposed conditions, the material properties and limits, and the material response. It places types of damage relative to each other on fretting maps. A flow chart starting from the imposed conditions and ending with failure, and showing all possible alternatives, is drawn. The chart is then discussed in the light of fretting wear and fretting fatigue tests. It is shown that it is common during one test to cover both overstressing and overstraining conditions which complicates the interpretation of data. Static fretting fatigue which avoids that complication is therefore recommended. {\textcopyright} 1992.},

It is found that the conical indenter gives an indentation fracture similar to that by the cube corner indenter. The cube corner indenter results in a larger stress concentration leading to fracture of films at lower loads. Based on the analysis of the energy release in cracking, the fracture toughness of the films was calculated. The results show that the conical indenter gives the same fracture toughness values as the cube corner indenter and these calculated values are in good agreement with those measured by conventional methods. {\textcopyright} 1998 Elsevier Science S.A.},

@article{Leyland2000,
abstract = {Although hardness has long been regarded as a primary material property which defines wear resistance, there is strong evidence to suggest that the elastic modulus can also have an important influence on wear behaviour. In particular, the elastic strain to failure, which is related to the ratio of hardness (H) and elastic modulus (E), has been shown by a number of authors to be a more suitable parameter for predicting wear resistance than is hardness alone. There is presently considerable interest in the development of nanostructured and nanolayered coatings, due to the fact that materials with extreme mechanical properties (which are difficult to synthesise by other methods) can be created, particularly when using plasma-assisted vacuum processing techniques. Until now, scientific research has been directed mainly towards the achievement of ultra-high hardness, with associated high elastic modulus, the latter of which, conventional fracture mechanics theory would suggest, is also desirable for wear improvement (by preventing crack propagation). In this study, we discuss the concept of nanocomposite coatings with high hardness and low elastic modulus, which can exhibit improved toughness, and are therefore better suited for optimising the wear resistance of 'real' industrial substrate materials (i.e. steels and light alloys, with similarly low moduli). Recent advances in the development of ceramic-ceramic, ceramic-amorphous and ceramic-metal nanocomposite coatings are summarized and discussed in terms of their relevance to practical applications. We also discuss the significance of elastic strain to failure (which is related to H/E) and fracture toughness in determining tribological behaviour and introduce the topic of metallic nanocomposite coatings which, although not necessarily exhibiting extreme hardness, may provide superior wear resistance when deposited on the types of substrate material which industry needs to use.

abstract = {Experimental observations and theoretical analysis show that the contact conditions in fretting change with increasing displacement amplitude. Three different regimes of fretting are distinguished using dynamic tangential force and displacement measurements. The corresponding modes of surface damage can be identified from post-test metallographic examination. The three regimes are as follows. 1. (1) Stick regime. Very limited surface damage by oxidation and wear. No fatigue crack formation observed (up to 106 cycles). Low damage fretting. 2. (2) Mixed stick-slip regime. Wear and oxidation effects are small. Accelerated crack growth may result in strongly reduced fatigue life. Fretting fatigue. 3. (3) Gross slip regime. Severe surface damage by wear, assisted by oxidation. Crack formation limited. Fretting wear. In addition, the limiting conditions at which wear mechanisms and wear rates become identical to those in unidirectional sliding must be considered. This case is referred to as the reciprocating sliding regime. In practical applications, it is important to determine the fretting regime resulting from a given set of experimental conditions. In the present paper the concept of "fretting maps" is introduced as a tool to be used in this determination. A fretting map is a diagram showing the relevant regimes in two variables, with regime boundaries representing critical values for the transition from one regime to another. Examples of fretting maps with variation of displacement amplitude, normal and tangential force and frequency of vibration are given. The advantage of fretting maps in analysing experimental fretting results is illustrated by a comparison with literature data. {\textcopyright} 1988.},

Surface topographies, lubricant layers, contaminants, operating conditions, and others control it, i.e., this movement depends on the tribological characteristics of a system. Before the industrial revolution, friction and wear were controlled by the application of animal fat or oil. During the industrial revolution, with the introduction of trains and other machinery, the operating conditions at the contacting surfaces changed dramatically. New bearings were designed and built and simple lubrication measures were no longer satisfactory. It became critical to understand the lubrication mechanisms involved. During that period, solid theoretical foundations, leading to the development of new technologies, were laid. The field of tribology had gained a significant prominence, i.e., it became clear that without advancements in tribology the technological progress would be limited. It was no longer necessary to build oversized ship bearings hoping that they would work. The ship or automobile bearings could now be optimized and their behavior predicted. By the middle of the 20th century, lubrication mechanisms in non-conformal contacts, i.e., in gears, rolling contact bearings, cams and tappets, etc., were also finally understood.},

With the development of low-emission and low-consumption engines, diamond-like carbon (DLC) coatings have been considered as promising surface coatings of engine parts in terms of friction and wear performance. However, the performance of DLC-coated parts depends on the compatibility and interaction between the coating and lubricant additives. To obtain high-performance coatings in the engine environment, the tribological behaviors of non-doped and metal-doped carbon-based coatings (a-C and a-C/WC, respectively) were studied systematically in poly-alpha-olefin (PAO) oil at 180 °C (operating temperature of engine oil) with and without antiwear additive zinc dialkyldithiophosphate (ZDDP) under various applied loads. Energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy, Raman spectroscopy, and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy were performed on a friction surface to understand tribological mechanisms. Results showed that ZDDP-derived tribofilms were able to suppress the surface graphitization of carbon-based coatings. The combination of ZDDP-derived tribofilms and tribochemical products WS 2 /WO 2 , which formed under the joint actions of heat and contract pressure, led to improved tribological behavior of a-C/WC coating in PAO with ZDDP additive.},

abstract = {Diamond may be grown at low pressures where it is the metastable form of carbon. Recent advances in a wide variety of plasma and electrical discharge methods have led to dramatic increases in growth rates. All of these methods have certain aspects in common, namely, the presence of atomic hydrogen and the production of energetic carbon-containing fragments under conditions that support high mobilities on the diamond surface. Some understanding of the processes taking place during nucleation and growth of diamond has been achieved, but detailed molecular mechanisms are not yet known. Related research has led to the discovery of a new class of materials, the "diamondlike" phases. Vapor-grown diamond and diamondlike materials may have eventual applications in abrasives, tool coatings, bearing surfaces, electronics, optics, tribological surfaces, and corrosion protection.},

abstract = {Two hard, carbon-based solid lubricant coatings, Graphit-iC ™ and Dymon-iC™, have been developed which offer considerable benefits over traditional diamond-like carbon (DLC) coatings. Both have extremely high wear resistance and load-bearing capability, in contrast to many commercial DLCs which tend to be brittle, and very low friction characteristics. The development of the coatings is described, and details of their tribological properties in air and water are given. The structure of the coatings has been studied and related to the tribological properties, and the mechanism for the low friction and wear rates is discussed. The coatings are proving successful in increasing the lifetime and efficiency of many mechanical parts, including automotive fuel injection components, gears, bearings, tappets, gudgeon pins, etc. They offer benefits for tooling, used for forming or machining of soft materials, and are used on dies and moulds. Other application areas include surgical tools and implants. {\textcopyright} 2004 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

abstract = {Abstract Diamond like carbon (DLC) coatings have been investigated for application in the automotive valve train and, in particular, the camshaft drive assembly. The drive assembly can have various force transfer devices, such as an overhead bucket tappet assembly or a cam follower assembly. Force transfer devices operate in severe tribological contact situations with maximum Hertzian stresses approaching 1 GN m−2 and temperatures in the range 100–150°C. Lubrication is often partially starved and, therefore, the thermochemical properties and surface finish of the components are critical to their successful operation. For motor sport applications, DLC offers improved wear resistance over steel alone; and for passenger vehicles, the high hardness and commensurately lower friction coefficient that DLC gives against steel counterfaces offers improvements in fuel economy and lower wear. This paper presents the results from an investigation of the wear of DLC coated shims against standard production camshafts. ...},

A new chapter on depth sensing indentation has been added, and the contents of the other chapters have been completely overhauled with added figures, formulae and explanations. The author begins with an introduction to the mechanical properties of materials, general fracture mechanics and the fracture of brittle solids. This is followed by a detailed description of indentation stress fields for both elastic and elastic-plastic contact. The discussion then turns to the formation of Hertzian cone cracks in brittle materials, subsurface damage in ductile materials, and the meaning of hardness. The author concludes with an overview of practical methods of indentation.},

These coatings were comparatively studied in terms of phase stability after thermal annealing at 250, 500, 750, and 1000 °C in argon using Raman and x-ray absorption near-edge spectroscopy techniques. The main differences were observed at temperatures above 500 °C when oxidation processes occur and the mechanical properties deteriorate. At 1000 °C, the samples were fully oxidized forming a-C, TiO2, and B2O3 as final products. Higher hardness and reduced indentation modulus values and better tribological properties were observed at 750 °C for nanocomposite structures including amorphous carbon and ternary TiBxCy phases. This behavior is attributed to a protective effect associated with the a-C phase which is achieved by the encapsulation of the nanocrystals in the coating and the better hard/lubricant phase ratio associated with this type of ...},

abstract = {Advanced nanomechanical testing has been used to evaluate key factors influencing tool life (1) a plasticity index (PI, the plastic work done/total work done during indentation), at room and elevated temperature (2) hot hardness and (3) fatigue fracture resistance, and determine their relative importance in different cutting applications. The optimum combination of hardness and toughness/plasticity to minimise wear and extend the life of coated WC-Co cutting tools was found to vary with the severity and nature of the cutting conditions. For interrupted cutting the plasticity index is critical, with high values (i.e. not extremely high H/E) resulting in extended tool life. Elevated temperature nanoindentation showed decreasing hardness and increasing PI with temperature. In high-speed turning hot hardness is the dominant factor whilst for interrupted cutting high hot hardness should be combined with improved plasticity for longer tool life. A novel test technique nano-impact, was used to simulate the interrupted contact (and cyclic loading) conditions occurring in milling applications and evaluate the fatigue fracture resistance of coated tools. It was able to successfully rank coatings in terms of tool life in end milling and reproduce the evolution of tool wear in the cutting test. In elevated temperature nano-impact testing the probability and extent of fracture during the test decreased at elevated temperature, consistent with the higher PI. Results from the advanced nanomechanical tests can be used in combination to predict which coatings have longer life in severe cutting conditions. {\textcopyright} 2009 Elsevier B.V.

@article{Thornton1989,
abstract = {Note: This summary article first appeared in the Proceedings of the 22nd Annual Technical Conference of the Society of Vacuum Coaters in 1979. It is reproduced here, with permission, for both its technical and historical significance. In it are found a number of the insights and instructive sketches characteristic of John Thornton, which in this case were known only to those few having access to the proceedings volume. Virtually all vacuum-deposited coatings are in a state of stress. The total stress is composed of a thermal stress and an intrinsic stress. The thermal stress is due to the difference in the thermal expansion coefficients of the coating and the substrate materials. The intrinsic stress is due to the accumulating effect of the crystallographic flaws that are built into the coating during deposition. In soft, low melting point materials such as aluminum, bulk diffusion tends to relax the internal stresses and to prevent their accumulation. However, these diffusion processes can cause flaws such as holes and hillocks to form. In hard, higher melting point materials such as chromium deposited at low temperatures (e.g. the case of decorative coatings on plastic substrates), intrinsic stresses accumulate and tend to dominate over thermal stresses. Stress cracking and buckling are commonly observed. The fundamental nature of the internal stresses that are found in both evaporated and sputtered coatings is reviewed in this paper from the point of view of decorative coating applications. Recent sputtering studies are described which indicate that apparatus geometry is particularly important in determining the state of stress that forms in deposits. {\textcopyright} 1989.},

abstract = {Between 1965 and 1993 areal bit density in hard disc recording heads grew at a rate of 45{\%} per year. Subsequently the rate of growth increased to 65{\%} through 1998. In the past 2 years, the density growth has increased yet again to an amazing 100{\%} per year. Increasing areal density requires growth in both track and linear density. Products currently in production have areal density in the range of 10 to 15 Gbit/inch2. At a continuing density growth rate of 100{\%} per year, 100 Gbit/inch2production will become a reality in year 2003, less than 3 years hence. Reduction in head-to-media magnetic spacing follows areal density growth. Protective coatings on both the heads and the media contribute to spacing. One of the clear challenges going forward is reduction of the coating thickness while maintaining the functional properties of corrosion protection and tribology enhancement. Traditional direct ion beam DLC deposition coatings do not have the required properties at thickness below 30 {\AA}. New coating technology is required to meet the needs of the recording head industry. This paper will address the coating requirements as well as the test methods used to evaluate coatings. {\textcopyright} 2001 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.},

abstract = {It is usually assumed that the real area of contact between two nominally flat metal surfaces is determined by the plastic deformation of their highest asperities. This leads at once to the result that the real area of contact is directly proportional to the load and independent of the apparent area-a result with many applications in the theories of electric contacts and friction. Archard pointed out that plastic deformation could not be the universal rule, and introduced a model which showed that, contrary to earlier ideas, the area of contact could be proportional to the load even with purely elastic contact. This paper describes a new theory of elastic contact, which is more closely related to real surfaces than earlier theories. We show how the contact deformation depends on the topography of the surface, and establish the criterion for distinguishing surfaces which touch elastically from those which touch plastically. The theory also indicates the existence of an 'elastic contact hardness', a composite quantity depending on the elastic properties and the topography, which plays the same role in elastic contact as the conventional hardness does in plastic contact. A new instrument for measuring surface topography has been built; with it the various parameters shown by the theory to govern surface contact can be measured experimentally. The typical radii of surface asperities have been measured. They were found, surprisingly, to be orders of magnitude larger than the heights of the asperities. More generally we have been able to study the distributions of asperity heights and of other surface features for a variety of surfaces prepared by standard techniques. Using these data we find that contact between surfaces is frequently plastic, as usually assumed, but that surfaces which touch elastically are by no means uncommon in engineering practice.},

abstract = {Nanotribology and nanomechanics studies are needed to develop fundamental understanding of interfacial phenomena on a small scale and to study interfacial phenomena in magnetic storage devices, nanotechnology and other applications. Friction and wear of lightly loaded micro/nanocomponents are highly dependent on the surface interactions (a few atomic layers). These structures are generally coated with molecularly thin films. Nanotribology and nanomechanics studies are also valuable in the fundamental understanding of interfacial phenomena in macrostructures and provide a bridge between science and engineering. An atomic force microscope (AFM) tip is used to simulate a single-asperity contact with a solid or lubricated surface. AFMs are used to study the various tribological phenomena that include surface roughness, adhesion, friction, scratching, wear and boundary lubrication. In situ surface characterization of local deformation of materials and thin coatings can be carried out using a tensile stage inside an AFM. Mechanical properties such as hardness, Young's modulus of elasticity and creep/relaxation behaviour can be determined on micro- to picoscales using a depth-sensing indentation system in an AFM.},

According to the principle of the same area-to-depth ratio, a non-ideally pyramidal indenter like a Berkovich one can be approximated by a non-ideally conical indenter with a spherical cap at the tip. By applying dimensional and finite element analysis to the non-ideally conical indentation, a set of approximate one-to-one relationships between the ratio of nominal hardness/reduced Youngs modulus and the ratio of elastic work/total work, which correspond to different tip bluntness, have been revealed. The nominal hardness is defined as the maximum indentation load divided by the cross-section area of the conical indenter specified at the maximum indentation depth. As a consequence, Youngs modulus can be determined from a nanoindentation test only using the maximum indentation load and depth, and the work done during loading and unloading processes. The new method for determining Youngs modulus is referred to as pure energy method. The validity of the method was examined by performing indentation tests on five materials. The experimental results and the standard reference values are in good agreement, indicating that the proposed pure energy method is a promising substitution for the most widely used analysis models at present.},

abstract = {In aluminium die casting, tools are exposed to erosion, corrosion and soldering due to the frequent contact of the tool surface to the casting alloy, to heat checking and gross cracking due to thermal fatigue and to oxidation due to high pouring temperatures. The gradual destruction of die surfaces during service decreases casting piece quality and limits die lifetime. Hard coatings based on nitrides or carbides of transition metals may protect the steel surface from erosion and soldering of aluminium and improve the resistance against thermal cracking. Thus, they may replace the thick oxide-based die coatings nowadays used in foundries. Within this study, results obtained on the performance of coatings deposited onto die-casting dies by magnetron sputtering and plasma-assisted chemical vapour deposition are presented and discussed. TiN, Ti(C,N), Ti(B,N), and (Ti,Al)(C,N) coatings deposited onto hot-working tool steel have been evaluated in practical die-casting service. Results obtained are compared with those of simulation tests using thermal cycling immersion tests in liquid aluminium, thermo-gravimetric analysis, and stress measurements during thermal cycling. Maximum lifetime of the coated casting die is achieved for careful optimization of hardness, adhesion, oxidation resistance and high temperature stability, and internal stresses.

abstract = {Zeolites are a class of crystalline oxides that have uniform and molecular-sized pores (3-12 A in diameter). Although natural zeolites were first discovered in 1756, significant commercial development did not begin until the 1950s when synthetic zeolites with high purity and controlled chemical composition became available. Since then, major commercial applications of zeolites have been limited to catalysis, adsorption, and ion exchange, all using zeolites in powder form. Although researchers have widely investigated zeolite thin films within the last 15 years, most of these studies were motivated by the potential application of these materials as separation membranes and membrane reactors. In the last decade, we have recognized and demonstrated that zeolite thin films can have new, diverse, and economically significant applications that others had not previously considered. In this Account, we highlight our work on the development of zeolite thin films as low-dielectric constant (low-k) insulators for future generation computer chips, environmentally benign corrosion-resistant coatings for aerospace alloys, and hydrophilic and microbiocidal coatings for gravity-independent water separation in space stations. Although these three applications might not seem directly related, they all rely on the ability to fine-tune important macroscopic properties of zeolites by changing their ratio of silicon to aluminum. For example, pure-silica zeolites (PSZs, Si/Al = infinity) are hydrophobic, acid stable, and have no ion exchange capacity, while low-silica zeolites (LSZs, Si/Al {\textless} 2) are hydrophilic, acid soluble, and have a high ion exchange capacity. These new thin films also take advantage of some unique properties of zeolites that have not been exploited before, such as a higher elastic modulus, hardness, and heat conductivity than those of amorphous porous silicas, and microbiocidal capabilities derived from their ion exchange capacities. Finally, we briefly discuss our more recent work on polycrystalline zeolite thin films as promising biocompatible coatings and environmentally benign wear-resistant and antifouling coatings. When zeolites are incorporated into polymer thin films in the form of nanocrystals, we also show that the resultant composite membranes can significantly improve the performance of reverse osmosis membranes for sea water desalination and proton exchange membrane fuel cells. These diverse applications of zeolites have the potential to initiate new industries while revolutionizing existing ones with a potential economic impact that could extend into the hundreds of billions of dollars. We have licensed several of these inventions to companies with millions of dollars invested in their commercial development. We expect that other related technologies will be licensed in the near future.},

abstract = {Abstract Although indentation experiments have long been used to measure the hardness and Young's modulus, the utility of this technique in analyzing the complete elastic-plastic response of materials under contact loading has only been realized in the past few years - mostly due to recent advances in testing equipment and analysis protocols. This paper provides a timely review of the recent progress made in this respect in extracting meaningful indentation stress-strain curves from the raw datasets measured in instrumented spherical nanoindentation experiments. These indentation stress-strain curves have produced highly reliable estimates of the indentation modulus and the indentation yield strength in the sample, as well as certain aspects of their post-yield behavior, and have been critically validated through numerical simulations using finite element models as well as direct in situ scanning electron microscopy (SEM) measurements on micro-pillars. Much of this recent progress was made possible through the introduction of a new measure of indentation strain and the development of new protocols to locate the effective zero-point of initial contact between the indenter and the sample in the measured datasets. This has led to an important key advance in this field where it is now possible to reliably identify and analyze the initial loading segment in the indentation experiments. Major advances have also been made in correlating the local mechanical response measured in nanoindentation with the local measurements of structure at the indentation site using complementary techniques. For example, it has been shown that the combined use of Orientation Imaging Microscopy (OIM, using Electron BackScattered Diffraction (EBSD)) and nanoindentation on polycrystalline metallic samples can yield important information on the orientation dependence of indentation yield stress, which can in turn be used to estimate percentage increase in the local slip resistance in deformed samples. The same methods have been used successfully to probe the intrinsic role of grain boundaries in the overall mechanical deformation of the sample. More recently, these protocols have been extended to characterize local mechanical property changes in the damaged layers in ion-irradiated metals. Similarly, the combined use of Raman spectroscopy and nanoindentation on samples of mouse bone has revealed tissue-level correlations between the mineral content at the indentation site and the associated local mechanical properties. The new protocols have also provided several new insights into the buckling response in dense carbon nanotube (CNT) brushes. These and other recent successful applications of nanoindentation are expected to provide the critically needed information for the maturation of physics-based multiscale models for the mechanical behavior of most advanced materials. In this paper, we review these latest developments and identify the future challenges that lie ahead.},

Over a wide range of experimental conditions the CoCr alloy showed significantly better wear resistance.

abstract = {Fretting situations are becoming increasingly important for industrial applications. Numerous studies have been undertaken to understand the damage created by low-amplitude reciprocating motion, particularly in the case of a ball on flat contact in dry conditions. The loading condition of materials can be characterized by a "running condition fretting map" which describes, in a graph of normal load versus displacement amplitude, the various domains of sliding: partial or gross slip. By considering the time evolution of sliding conditions, various regimes can be defined: a partial slip regime when partial slip is observed throughout the test, a gross slip regime for gross slip, and a mixed regime when both partial and gross slip are observed. The response of the material is, of course, dependent on the sliding regime: crack initiation and propagation are related more to the mixed regime, while surface transformations and loss of matter are related more to the gross slip regime. This paper analyzes the fretting gross slip situation and describes the loss of matter in the case of hard coatings deposited on high-speed steel. Two aspects are considered: (i) the wear volume measurements are usually performed using 3D topography, whereas modeling of the wear scar morphology indicates that valuable estimates of the worn volume can be obtained by 2D profilometry, which is much less time-consuming than 3D topography; and (ii) the wear volume observed in experiments is related to the energy dissipated in the contact at both the global scale and the local scale where the wear depth is an important parameter. With this energy approach, the wear behaviour of a TiN-coated and uncoated high-speed steel can be compared quantitatively. {\textcopyright} 1997 Elsevier Science S.A. All rights reserved.},

Adhesion of a-C:H films on ferrous alloys is poor due to chemical and physical aspects, avoiding a widespread application of such a film. One possibility to overcome this inconvenient is depositing an interlayer – an intermediate thin film – between the carbon-based coating and the substrate to improve good chemical interaction and proper adhesion. Based on this, interlayers play a key role on a-C:H thin film adhesion through a better chemical network structure at the outermost layer of the a-SiCx:H interlayer, i, e., the a-C:H/a-SiCx:H interface. However, even though the latest important advances on the subject, the coating adhesion continues being a cumbersome problem since it depends on multifactorial causes.

abstract = {Surface engineering using applied coatings has become a well-established technology and is an extremely versatile means of improving component performance. Tribological coatings add physical properties, such as lubricity, hardness, or corrosion resistance, to lower-valued substrates that improve the overall quality of the component. In addition, the substrate can be designed for strength and toughness to avoid catastrophic failure of the component. This message is often misinterpreted by end-users of coated components, however, in the sense that it is believed that a thin surface coating can provide superior performance to a component made out of a cheap low quality bulk material. In addition, suppliers of tribological coatings often offer coatings on a trial and error basis without a systematic approach, resulting in few successes with many disappointments. In this paper some typical aspects of tribological coatings will be highlighted, emphasising that a coated component must be regarded as a composite structure. Both the coating and the substrate should be optimised taking into account mechanical, structural, chemical, electrical, thermal, and dimensional properties. Techniques are presented for the reliable testing of thin surface coatings, and a generic methodology is suggested using surface coating technology for systematic problem solving of friction and wear cases. Finally, an example of the potential of thin surface films for tribological applications is given. {\textcopyright} 1997 Elsevier Science S.A.},

abstract = {The phase transformation of hydrogen-free amorphous carbon (a-C) coating on tungsten high speed steel (SKH2) substrates under repetitive impact testing has been studied. The a-C coated disc was impacted by the chromium molybdenum steel (SCM420) pin at several different impact loads and impact cycles (up to 100,000) under lubricated conditions. The results show that the sp3 fractions of impacted a-C coating obtained from the surface of impact craters are significantly increased with impact cycles due to decreasing ID/IG ratio. This means that the amorphization of a-C coating also increased after several impact cycles. As for the full-width at half maximum (FWHM) of G peak characterization, it is shown that the hardness of impacted a-C coating is higher than the as-received. From the observation of surface roughness using atomic force microscopy (AFM), it is supposed that increasing sp3 fractions and the hardness of the impacted a-C coating during impact correlate to the reduction of surface roughness. In addition, the tribochemical reaction to the environment during impact occurred at the mating material, where the transfer layer adhered, as well as in the wear debris. This is due to the oxidation of ferrum (Fe) to magnetite (Fe3O4) and hematite ($\alpha$-Fe2O3) phases with predominant peak at about 680cm-1 and 1317cm-1, respectively. The formation of Fe3O4 and $\alpha$-Fe2O3 phases was revealed from Raman spectroscopy and the existence of oxide elements was verified by energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopic (EDS) analysis. Increasing the G peak position, together with a concomitant decrease of their width, it is believed that the structural transformation from sp3 to sp2 is taking place within the wear debris and leads to the graphitization process at a higher contact pressure. It was suggested that the high contact pressure is not just only corresponding to the applied normal impact load, but it is also exerted by an oil lubricant during impact. A high contact pressure can significantly reduce the graphitization temperature and substantially accelerate the graphitization process. However, a significant phase transformation of the transfer layer on the SCM420 pin does not intensely occur because it is mainly coming from the surface layer of the impacted a-C coating, where the sp3 content increases and no wear debris is observed inside it. {\textcopyright} 2010 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract = {During the past two decades, diamond-like carbon (DLC) films have attracted an overwhelming interest from both industry and the research community. These films offer a wide range of exceptional physical, mechanical, biomedical and tribological properties that make them scientifically very fascinating and commercially essential for numerous industrial applications. Mechanically, certain DLC films are extremely hard (as hard as 90 GPa) and resilient, while tribologically they provide some of the lowest known friction and wear coefficients. Their optical and electrical properties are also extraordinary and can be tailored to meet the specific requirements of a given application. Because of their excellent chemical inertness, these films are resistant to corrosive and/or oxidative attacks in acidic and saline media. The combination of such a wide range of outstanding properties in one material is rather uncommon, so DLC can be very useful in meeting the multifunctional application needs of advanced mechanical systems. In fact, these films are now used in numerous industrial applications, including razor blades, magnetic hard discs, critical engine parts, mechanical face seals, scratch-resistant glasses, invasive and implantable medical devices and microelectromechanical systems. DLC films are primarily made of carbon atoms that are extracted or derived from carbon-containing sources, such as solid carbon targets and liquid and gaseous forms of hydrocarbons and fullerenes. Depending on the type of carbon source being used during the film deposition, the type of bonds (i.e. sp1, sp2, sp3) that hold carbon atoms together in DLC may vary a great deal and can affect their mechanical, electrical, optical and tribological properties. Recent systematic studies of DLC films have confirmed that the presence or absence of certain elemental species, such as hydrogen, nitrogen, sulfur, silicon, tungsten, titanium and fluorine, in their microstructure can also play significant roles in their properties. The main goal of this review paper is to highlight the most recent developments in the synthesis, characterization and application of DLC films. We will also discuss the progress made in understanding the fundamental mechanisms that control their very unique friction and wear behaviours. Novel design concepts and the principles of superlubricity in DLC films are also presented. 2006 IOP Publishing Ltd.},

Diamond-like carbon has been shown to provide this capability and to prevent leaching of metallic ions into the body. There are many ways to deposit such coatings from carbonaceous precursors, and some offer the means to incorporate other elements such as nitrogen, titanium, or silver. All reported tests of the biocompatibility of DLC coatings have been successful. This review will summarize work done on orthopedic and cardiovascular components together with other medical applications. For optimum tribological performance, the DLC must be deposited onto highly polished surfaces.

abstract = {Fretting wear, defined as a small displacement amplitude oscillatory motion between two solids in contact, is usually induced by vibrations. In the case of surface coatings application it is crucial to establish when the substrate is reached to prevent from catastrophic consequences. Moreover, a reliable selection of surface treatment is of great interest for industrial applications. In this work fretting tests were carried out on different PVD hard coatings (TiN, TiC, TiCN, VC, TiC/VC, (TiC/VC)x2) under wide range of normal loadings and displacement amplitudes. A ball-against-flat specimen arrangement has been analyzed under gross slip fretting regime. The coatings durability criterion based on local dissipated energy has been developed and related to the friction process. The wear depth extension is referred to the cumulated density of friction work dissipated during the test. An averaged cumulated density of dissipated friction energy is successively introduced to rationalize the coating lifetime. The critical dissipated energy density related to the coatings durability has been determined for each analyzed coating and the critical number of fretting cycles has been established. Taking into account this critical value an Energy Density—Coating Endurance chart has been proposed where the coating duration is predicted as a function of the pressure, the displacement amplitude and the friction coefficient. Nevertheless, some divergence has been observed between the predicted and detected surface coating endurance. This has been explained by a coating spalling phenomenon observed below a critical residual coating thickness. Introducing an effective wear coating parameter the coating endurance is better quantified and finally an effective energy density threshold, associated to a friction energy capacity approach, is introduced to rationalize the coating endurance prediction. The investigated hard coatings are compared independently of the loading conditions and its thickness. Finally the global procedure to establish the coatings durability has been presented.},

abstract = {The generation of wear particles is now considered one of the most important failures in total arthroplasty. It is especially needed to study damage process of the particles at slight movement and lower load for long-term service of implanted materials. The wear and abrasion behavior of particles on Ti-6A1-4V coated with diamond-like carbon (DLC) were appropriately simulated in the present paper by fretting wear and nano-scratch test. The coatings with a thickness of 2.5 $\mu$m were deposited with an r.f.-plasma enhanced chemical vapor deposition method. The analytic techniques employed to assess DLC coatings characterization include SEM, AFM, Raman and IR spectroscopy. Assessment of hardness, elastic modulus, abrasion and adhesion of the coatings were performed using a Nano Indenter XP system with attachments of continuous stiffness measurements (CSM) and lateral force measurements (LFM). Tribological properties of the coatings were evaluated by a fretting wear test. It was concluded that the DLC coatings had a smooth surface morphology with a rms of 6.8 nm and possessed good adhesion to the substrate, they recovered fully elastic at lower load (60 mN) and were ploughed and delaminated only partially at higher load (400 mN). Nevertheless, there was wear debris concurrently generated during the nano-scratch and fretting test, which was more evident at high loads for a definite coatings, indicating an essential necessity of the work to improve the wear resistant of the coatings to avoid the generation of wear debris. The friction coefficient of DLC coatings against corundum obtained by fretting test decreased with the increase of relative humidity, it was below 0.1 in an aqueous condition, this may be beneficial to their biomedical applications in body fluids. {\textcopyright} 2001 Elsevier Science B.V.

abstract = {Fuel economy and environmental protection have become increasingly important over the last few decades and this has led to the demand for higher efficiency within the automotive sector. Non-ferrous coatings with excellent and unique tribological properties, intended to increase efficiency by lowering friction and wear internally within the car engine are becoming increasingly more prevalent within this sector. Since current lubrication practices are geared towards ferrous materials, it is important to determine the effect that lubricants have on non-traditional coatings. In this study, three Diamond-Like Carbon (DLC) coatings are assessed for their viability within this application, more specifically for the cam-follower interface. The coatings are an amorphous hydrogenated Diamond-Like Carbon and a silicon doped amorphous hydrogenated Diamond-Like Carbon, both produced at the University of Leeds, using a Hauzer Flexicoat 850 deposition system, and a tungsten doped Diamond-Like Carbon coating from Oerlikon Balzers, type Balanit C*. The coatings are characterised to quantify their hardness, thickness, elastic modulus and sp2 content before being tribologically tested in group III base oil and fully formulated oil containing the anti-wear additive zinc dialkyldithiophosphate on a pin-on-reciprocating plate tribometer. The three DLCs are tested against a cast iron counter-body and analysed for wear and the presence of a phosphate tribo-film. The nature of growth of the tribo-film is commonly known for ferrous contacts but much uncertainty still remains for DLC lubricated contacts. The Hauzer Flexicoat 850 system houses within it two microwave sources which aid in the Plasma Enhanced Chemical Vapour Deposition (PECVD) of DLC. This new technology offers potentially improved coatings for tribological coatings and the ability to tailor the coating for a particular lubricant. In this study the microwave PECVD process is tested to determine its viability within a commercial setting, and to discover the effect of different processing parameters on the mechanical properties of the coatings. The parameters of particular interest are the bias voltage, gas ratio and power of the microwave sources. Preliminary tests were undertaken in order to determine the optimum position and other fundamental deposition properties before the full scale tests began. This study has shown that a-C:H DLC is the most suitable coating of those tested here for implementation into this application. The Si-DLC and W-DLC were not compatible with the lubricants or the system as will be shown. The lubricant additive ZDDP is important in ferrous systems, and it is shown here to be useful within a DLC environment The microwave DLC coatings have demonstrated good mechanical properties, in particular a high hardness. They have proven to be very promising, and with a substantial reduction in deposition time, demonstrate their potential commercial viability for tribological applications},

abstract = {DLC coatings have been deposited onto substrate of Ti alloy (Ti-6Al-4V) using r.f. PACVD (plasma-assisted chemical vapor deposition) with C 6H6, and mixture of C6H6 and SiH4 as the process gases. Three kinds of DLC coatings were prepared as a function of diverse bias voltage and Si incorporation. Corrosion performance of DLC coatings was investigated by electrochemical techniques (potentiodynamic polarization test and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy) and surface analyses (atomic force microscopy and scanning electron microscopy). The electrolyte used in this test was a 0.89{\%} NaCl solution of pH 7.4 at temperature 37??C. The porosity and protective efficiency of DLC coatings were obtained using potentiodynamic polarization test. Moreover, the delamination area and volume fraction of water uptake of DLC coatings as a function of immersion time were calculated using electrochemical impedance spectroscopy. This study provides the reliable and quantitative data for assessment of the effect of Si incorporation and an increase of bias voltage- on corrosion performance. In conclusion, electrochemical measurements showed that DLC coatings with Si addition and an increase of bias voltage could improve corrosion resistance in the simulated corrosive environment of the body fluid by a 0.89{\%} NaCl solution. This could be attributed to the formation of a dense and low-porosity coating, which impede the penetration of water and ions. ?? 2004 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

abstract = {Diamond-like carbon (DLC) coatings are currently being used in a wide variety of industrial fields because of their outstanding properties, such as high hardness and low friction coefficient, among others. DLC coatings have various characteristics depending on the deposition method used. However, they have a problem regarding adhesion with the base material, which is a major factor hindering their expanded application in other fields. The adhesion of DLC coatings is generally evaluated using Rockwell indentation tests and scratch tests. These test methods induce damage in the specimen with the application of a single load. Accordingly, there is a problem of low correlation between such test results and evaluations of the adhesion of coatings on actual components that undergo repeated sliding cycles. With the aim of resolving that problem, this study evaluated the damage condition of three types of DLC coatings having different physical properties using newly devised cyclic sliding test methods involving the application of a continuously increasing load. The evaluation results obtained with these new methods differed from the results of Rockwell tests and scratch tests. These new test methods are more able to reproduce the damage done to DLC coatings in actual sliding cycles. This paper describes the test procedures and the evaluation results obtained.},

abstract = {A hard TiN/CrN multilayered coating, consisting of alternating nanometer scale TiN and CrN layers (bilayer period of 40 nm), was deposited by arc evaporation process on M2 tool steel. Monolayered TiN and CrN are also deposited in the same conditions, and used as references. In order to get a better understanding of the tribological behaviour of coated parts, two types of experiments were performed. The dry-sliding wear resistance was evaluated with a ball-on-disk tribometer, while surface fatigue resistance was determined by a cyclic multi-impact test. The architecture of layers is measured by XRD and observed by TEM. The residual stress field was characterised using XRD and the sin2$\psi$ method at a synchrotron radiation facility. All coatings present a columnar microstructure. TiN demonstrated better wear resistance than CrN and this characteristic is still increased two times by using the nanostratified coating. In the same way, the results of surface oligo-cyclic fatigue test confirm the high performance of the nanostructured coating with respect to the monolayered ones. The differences in mechanical properties of coatings evaluated through nanoindentation measurements do not lead to a direct correlation with the tribological results, and therefore cannot explain such differences. Moreover, a microscopic analysis of the samples after both tribological tests reveals two opposite cracking mechanisms. Monolayered TiN and CrN are subjected to a transversal crack propagation until the peeling of the coating, whereas the multilayered coating only undergoes cohesive cracks deviated in the TiN/CrN interface zones. Both opposite behaviours are the consequence of the distribution of stresses along the thickness of the film. {\textcopyright} 2006 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

The concept of multi-level models of roughness and contact area is presented. Analysis of surface topography as a spatial pattern is given, when using the approaches of image recognition theory operating with the 3D digital images processing. Qualitatively the spatial structure is often characterized in terms of texture features such as random, linear, wavy etc., and some national standards introduce spatial structure of machined surfaces. However, texture characteristics are not adequately investigated. AFM images of different surfaces were used as initial data and multi-dimensional scaling technique was used for the data analysis. The study has shown that there are at least four types surface textures on nanoscale level.

@article{Voevodin1997,
abstract = {Super-hard and low-friction diamond-like carbon (DLC) coatings deposited at low temperatures are currently of great interest for wear protection and friction reduction. However, their high hardness (50–80 GPa), intrinsic stresses, and poor adhesion limit their use to applications where contact pressures are below I GPa and the coating thickness is below 0.5 $\mu$m to prevent cracking and delamination. These negative effects are especially pronounced when the coatings are applied to relatively soft substrates, such as steels. The limitations were removed by a multilayer design, where metal and ceramic layers were used to increase the load support capability, improve the adhesion strength, and increase the thickness of DLC layers. Existing approaches to the design of tough multilayer coatings were considered critically and a coating architecture was suggested using the following concepts: (i) formation of a load support and adhesion promoting underlayer with mechanical characteristics varied gradually from the substrate to the DLC layer; (ii) separation of hard DLC layers with interlayers of softer material to reduce stresses and brake cracks; (iii) use of crystalline interlayers with thickness permitting operation of dislocation sources for stress relaxation and deflection of cross-sectional cracks. The development of these concepts is discussed sequentially from bilayer ceramic/DLC coatings to functionally gradient metal/carbide/DLC coatings, and finally to nanocomposite coatings consisting of stacks of Ti/DLC, TiC/DLC, and CN/DLC layers with individual thickness within 10–60 nm deposited onto a gradient TiTiC-DLC underlayer. The coatings were deposited onto stainless steel substrates by a hybrid of magnetron sputtering and pulsed laser deposition. They had a 1–2 $\mu$m total thickness of super-hard (60–70 GPa) DLC layers and resisted delamination to 50–80 N loads in scratch adhesion tests. In ball-on-disk sliding tests, these coatings supported Hertzian contact pressures above 2 GPa and had friction coefficients around 0.1. Their wear lives exceed 106 cycles under initial contact pressures of 1.4 GPa. The conceptual architecture of multilayer nanocomposite coatings presented extends the range of wear resistant applications for super-hard DLC materials.},

abstract = {Ion plating is an atomistic vacuum coating process in which the depositing film is continuously or periodically bombarded by energetic atomic-sized inert or reactive particles that can affect the growth and properties of the film. The source of depositing atoms can be from vacuum evaporation, sputtering, arc vaporization or from a chemical vapor precursor. Bombarding species are generally either ions accelerated from a plasma in the deposition chamber (‘plasma-based' ion plating) or ions from an ‘ion source' (‘vacuum-based' ion plating). The stages of ion plating can be differentiated into surface preparation, nucleation and interface formation, and film growth. Ion plating was first described in the early 1960s and was initially used to enhance film adhesion and improve surface coverage. Later it was shown that controlled bombardment could be used to modify film properties such as density, morphology, index of refraction, and residual film stress. More recently the bombardment has been used to enhance chemical reactions in reactive and quasireactive deposition processes. Presently, ionization and acceleration of the depositing film atoms (‘film ions') is being used for ‘directed deposition' to improve filling of surface features in semiconductor processing. This paper will review the history of the development of the ion plating process and how it has affected vacuum coating technology. Potential developments using the ion plating concept will be discussed.},

These include three hydrogenated-carbon films prepared by sputter deposition in a H2/Ar gas mixture (hydrogen contents of 20, 34, and 40 atomic {\%}) and a pure carbon film prepared by cathodic-arc plasma techniques. Each film was deposited on a silicon substrate to thickness of about 300 nm. The hardness and elastic modulus were measured using nanoindentation methods, and ultra-low load scratch tests were used to assess the scratch resistance of the films and measure friction coefficients. The results show that the hardness, elastic modulus, and scratch resistance of the 20{\%} and 34{\%} hydrogenated films are significantly greater than the 40{\%} film, thereby showing that there is a limit to the amount of hydrogen producing beneficial effects. The cathodic-arc film, with a hardness of greater than 59 GPa, is considerably harder than any of the hydrogenated films and has a superior scratch resistance.},

abstract = {{\textcopyright} 2018 IOP Publishing Ltd. Incomplete fuel burning inside an internal combustion engine results in the creation of soot in the form of nanoparticles. Some of these soot nanoparticles (SNP) become adsorbed into the lubricating oil film present on the cylinder walls, which adversely affects the tribological performance of the lubricant. In order to better understand the mechanisms underlying the wear caused by SNPs, it is important to understand the behavior of SNPs and to characterize potential changes in their mechanical properties (e.g. hardness) caused by (or during) mechanical stress. In this study, the behavior of individual SNPs originating from diesel engines was studied under compression. The experiments were performed in a transmission electron microscope using a nanoindentation device. The nanoparticles exhibited elasto-plastic behavior in response to consecutive compression cycles. From the experimental data, the Young's modulus and hardness of the SNPs were calculated. The Young's modulus and hardness of the nanoparticles increased with the number of compression cycles. Using an electron energy loss spectroscopy technique, it was shown that the sp 2 /sp 3 ratio within the compressed nanoparticle decreases, which is suggested to be the cause of the increase in elasticity and hardness. In order to corroborate the experimental findings, molecular dynamics simulations of a model SNP were performed. The SNP model was constructed using carbon and hydrogen atoms with morphology and composition comparable to those observed in the experiment. The model SNP was subjected to repeated compressions between two virtual rigid walls. During the simulation, the nanoparticle exhibited elasto-plastic behavior like that in the experiments. The results of the simulations confirm that the increase in the elastic modulus and hardness is associated with a decrease in the sp 2 /sp 3 ratio.},

abstract = {This paper highlights the future perspectives of sustainable tribology by examining the economic, environmental and social impact of three tribological case studies. One case study examines the sustainability and durability of micro-CHP systems looking the tribological phenomena generated within a scroll expander system. The scroll is the main part of a specific micro-CHP system and experiences wear and cavitation damage. The tribological optimization of the scroll expander improves the sustainability of the micro-CHP unit while it has a serious economic and environmental impact to the consumers and to the society in general. Another case study is focused on friction and wear performance of lifeboat launch slipways. The causes of high friction and wear during the RNLI's lifeboat launches along an inclined slipway are investigated with a view to reducing the environmental impact due to slipway panel wear and lubricant release into the marine environment. The project encompasses the sustainable design of slipway panels using design modifications based on tribological investigations to double their lifespan, while environmental and economic impact was significantly reduced by the use of biodegradable greases and water as lubricants. The final case study involves an investigation of recycled plastic materials to replace polyurethane used on skateboard wheels, scooters and similar applications. Polyurethane (PU) is difficult to recycle. With the dwindling resources and environmental problems facing the world today, recycling for both waste reduction and resource preservation has become an increasingly important aspect of sustainability. The tribological results showed that recycled polycarbonate plastic can effectively act as a substitute to polyurethane wheels. Moreover, sustainability considerations showing the environmental benefits of the use of recycled plastics over PU include reducing the CO 2 footprint by 50{\%} and the energy consumed by 60{\%}, among other benefits. These case studies emphasise the importance of sustainable tribology in our epoch showing that increased sustainability performance can be achieved through tribology to a significant extent in many cases, providing stability to our world and more viable long term growth to our societies. {\textcopyright} 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

Due to this industrial state-of-the-art, the students should meet some of these technologies during their study at the technical university. In the engineering practice, the most useful coating thickness evaluation method is the ball-cratering (calotest). The students' laboratory experiment consists of grinding out the ball-crater in selected sample of thin coating.

The delamination issue is one of the main reasons preventing wider applications of carbon vapour deposited films. In this work, we studied single and multilayer thin films of carbon and found that under certain deposition conditions, we were able to produce thin films free from delamination. Furthermore, we were able to stop film delaminating by adding a control layer. Two methods were used to deposit the carbon films: (1) filtered cathodic arc deposition with both negative DC and pulsed bias applied to the substrate and (2) RF plasma CVD with negative pulse bias up to 30 kV, 60 Hz, 100 $\mu$s. Both single and multilayer structures of carbon with different sp2and sp3ratios were deposited and it was found that, under controlled conditions, the overall stress was maintained at acceptable levels. Moreover, it was found that an additional control layer stopped ongoing delamination of the film. The structures of these multilayers were studied using Scanning Electron Microscopy (SEM) and Transmission Electron Microscopy (TEM). {\textcopyright} 2005 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

abstract = {This updated version of the popular handbook further explains all aspects of physical vapor deposition (PVD) process technology from the characterizing and preparing the substrate material, through deposition processing and film characterization, to post-deposition processing. The emphasis of the new edition remains on the aspects of the process flow that are critical to economical deposition of films that can meet the required performance specifications, with additional information to support the original material. The book covers subjects seldom treated in the literature: substrate characterization, adhesion, cleaning and the processing. The book also covers the widely discussed subjects of vacuum technology and the fundamentals of individual deposition processes. However, the author uniquely relates these topics to the practical issues that arise in PVD processing, such as contamination control and film growth effects, which are also rarely discussed in the literature. In bringing these subjects together in one book, the reader can understand the interrelationship between various aspects of the film deposition processing and the resulting film properties. The author draws upon his long experience with developing PVD processes and troubleshooting the processes in the manufacturing environment, to provide useful hints for not only avoiding problems, but also for solving problems when they arise. He uses actual experiences, called'war stories', to emphasize certain points. Special formatting of the text allows a reader who is already knowledgeable in the subject to scan through a section and find discussions that are of particular interest. The author has tried to make the subject index as useful as possible so that the reader can rapidly go to sections of particular interest. Extensive references allow the reader to pursue subjects in greater detail if desired. The book is intended to be both an introduction for those who are new to the field and a valuable resource to those already in the field. The discussion of transferring technology between R{\&}D and manufacturing provided in Appendix 1, will be of special interest to the manager or engineer responsible for moving a PVD product and process from R{\&}D into production. Appendix 2 has an extensive listing of periodical publications and professional societies that relate to PVD processing. The extensive Glossary of Terms and Acronyms provided in Appendix 3 will be of particular use to students and to those not fully conversant with the terminology of PVD processing or with the English language.Fully revised and updated to include the latest developments in PVD process technology‘War stories'drawn from the author's extensive experience emphasize important points in development and manufacturingAppendices include listings of periodicals and professional societies, terms and acronyms, and material on transferring technology between R{\&}D and manufacturing},

abstract = {Nanoindentation load-displacement curves provide a ''mechanical fingerprint'' of a materials response to contact deformation. Over the last few years, much attention has been focused on understanding the factors controlling the detailed shape of unloading curves so that parameters such as true contact area, Young's modulus, and an indentation hardness number can be derived. When the unloading curve is well behaved (by which we mean approximating to linear behavior, or alternatively, fitting a power-law relationship), then this approach can be very successful. However, when the test volume displays considerable elastic recovery as the load is removed [e.g., for many stiff hard materials and many inhomogeneous systems (e.g., those employing thin hard coatings)], then the unloading curve fits no existing model particularly well. This results in considerable difficulty in obtaining valid mechanical property data for these types of materials. An alternative approach, described here, is to attempt to understand the shapes of nanoindentation loading curve and thus quantitatively model the relationship between Young's modulus, indentation hardness, indenter geometry, and the resultant maximum displacement for a given load. This paper describes the development and refinement of a previous approach by Loubet et al.(1) originally suggested for a Vickers indenter, but applied here to understand the factors that control the shape of the loading curve during nanoindentation experiments with a pointed, trigonal (Berkovich) indenter. For a range of materials, the relationship P = K-m delta(2) was found to describe the indenter displacement, delta, in terms of the applied load P. For each material, K-m can be predicted from the Young's modulus (E) and the hardness (H). The result is that if either E or H is known, then the other may be calculated from the experimental loading curve. This approach provides an attractive alternative to finite element modeling and is a tractable approach for those cases where analysis of unloading curves is infeasible.},

abstract = {The fretting behaviour of a Ti-6Al-4V alloy was studied in a plain cylinder/plane contact configuration under ambient conditions. Inspired by a fretting map approach, a global quantitative methodology is introduced. The transition from partial to gross slip condition was defined through an energy discontinuity analysis. Dominated by adhesion phenomena, the friction coefficient behaviour at the sliding transition is formalized through pressure dependence formulations. The crack nucleation risk under stabilized partial slip condition is expressed through a closed form applying the Crossland's high cycle multiaxial fatigue criterion. Comparison with experiments concludes that the size effect must be considered. An averaged stress approach, based on the identification of an intrinsic representative damage volume, was developed and confirmed by comparing various loading conditions. Integrating both debris formation and debris ejection mechanisms, an energy wear approach is adapted to formalize the fretting wear response under gross slip conditions. Extending the classical Archard's formalism by considering the friction coefficient and sliding amplitude impacts, this wear energy model displays a very good stability through a wide range of pressure, sliding amplitude and test duration conditions. It is finally discussed how the introduction of a restricted number of "constitutive fretting damage variables" can be transposed in FEM codes to model more complex industrial contacts. {\textcopyright} 2004 Published by Elsevier B.V.},

abstract = {Predicting the binding mode of flexible polypeptides to proteins is an important task that falls outside the domain of applicability of most small molecule and protein−protein docking tools. Here, we test the small molecule flexible ligand docking program Glide on a set of 19 non-$\alpha$-helical peptides and systematically improve pose prediction accuracy by enhancing Glide sampling for flexible polypeptides. In addition, scoring of the poses was improved by post-processing with physics-based implicit solvent MM- GBSA calculations. Using the best RMSD among the top 10 scoring poses as a metric, the success rate (RMSD ≤ 2.0 {\AA} for the interface backbone atoms) increased from 21{\%} with default Glide SP settings to 58{\%} with the enhanced peptide sampling and scoring protocol in the case of redocking to the native protein structure. This approaches the accuracy of the recently developed Rosetta FlexPepDock method (63{\%} success for these 19 peptides) while being over 100 times faster. Cross-docking was performed for a subset of cases where an unbound receptor structure was available, and in that case, 40{\%} of peptides were docked successfully. We analyze the results and find that the optimized polypeptide protocol is most accurate for extended peptides of limited size and number of formal charges, defining a domain of applicability for this approach.},

abstract = {The scratch test has been used to assess coating adhesion for some time. In this test, a diamond indenter is drawn across the coated surface under an increasing load (either stepwise or continuous) until at some load, termed the critical load Lc, a well-defined failure event occurs; if this failure event represents the loss of coating-substrate adhesion then the critical load can be used as a qualitative measure of coating-substrate adhesion. However, it is well known that a range of possible failure modes can occur and only some of these are dependent on adhesion; other failure modes which depend on plastic deformation and fracture within the coating, rather than any adhesive failure at the coating-substrate interface, may be just as useful in the assessment of coating quality for tribological applications. In this study, titanium nitride coatings have been deposited onto a range of different substrates from soft nickel to a hard cemented carbide and the failure modes which occur during scratch testing have been identified. Failures fall into two general groups, depending on whether the substrate behaves in a brittle or ductile manner during the scratch test. Similar failure modes are observed for titanium nitride coatings produced by several deposition technologies, although there is some variation in the appearance of specific failures which is process dependent. Many of the same failure modes are also observed for other coating materials, such as ZrN or hard carbon, but several different types of failure are also observed. The generation of acoustic emission during the test is related to the occurrence of these different failure modes. The origin of the failure modes and the use of the scratch test to assess coating-substrate adhesion are discussed in the light of these observations. {\textcopyright} 1991.},

The work done during indentation is also studied. A relationship between the ratio of hardness to elastic modulus and the ratio of irreversible work to total work is discovered. This relationship offers a new method for obtaining hardness and elastic modulus. Finally, a scaling theory for indentation in power-law creep solids using self-similar indenters is developed.

Fretting behaviour is analysed for partial slip conditions which have been identified experimentally and theoretically (transition criteria developed using Mindlin's analysis). A Dang Van crack nucleation criterion is introduced for a ball-flat contact. Typical analytical expressions of the criterion were obtained on the surface and in the volume depending on the loading conditions and the contact system.

The tests were operated in a laboratory dry environment and in Hank's balanced salt solution (HBSS), which may act as a lubricant against sliding wear or cause corrosion degradation to metal substrates. Uncoated CoCr was superior to Ti6Al4V in the cyclic impact-sliding tests in either dry or wet test conditions, which was believed due to the higher stiffness and strong strain-induced work hardening of CoCr and inferior wear resistance of Ti6Al4V. As a widely used antifriction coating, DLC did not benefit but decreased the durability of the samples in impact-sliding tests under dry condition due to high impact loads which deformed coating surface quickly and invited hard particles to sliding couples. A cushion effect against impact forces by HBSS and a better support provided by stiffer CoCr contributed to an improved base for DLC coatings, compared to the Ti alloy; so the DLC-coated CoCr sample outperformed the DLC-coated Ti6AlV, especially under HBSS condition.},

abstract = {We investigate the effect of low-temperature metal pretreatments in order to improve the adhesion of CNx coatings on steel substrates, which is crucial for tribological applications. The substrate pretreatments were conducted using five different metal targets: Ti, Zr, Al, Cr, and W, operated in high power impulse magnetron sputtering mode, known to produce significant ionization of the sputtered material flux. The CNx adhesion, as assessed by Rockwell C tests, did not improve upon Ti and Zr pretreatments. This is primarily ascribed to the fact that no interlayer was formed owing to severe re-sputtering due to high fluxes of doubly-ionized metal species in the plasma. A slight improvement in adhesion was observed in the case an Al pretreatment was carried out, while the best results were obtained using Cr and W. Here, 30-s-long pretreatments were sufficient to clean the steel surface and form a metallic interlayer between substrate and coating. Transmission electron microscopy in combination with energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy revealed that Al, Cr, and W created intermixing zones at the interlayer/substrate and the interlayer/CNx interfaces. The steel surfaces, pretreated using Cr or W, showed the highest work of adhesion with WCradh = 1.77 J/m2 and WWadh = 1.66 J/m2, respectively.},

The strain distributions obtained from the three indenters tested were studied, in order to clarify the differences in the load-indentation depth curves and hardness values of both types of materials. For bulk materials, the differentiation between the results obtained with the three indenters is material sensitive. The indenter geometry shape factor, $\beta$, for evaluating Young's modulus for each indenter, was also estimated. Depending on the indenter geometry, distinct mechanical behaviours are observed for composite materials, which are related to the size of the indentation region in the film. The indentation depth at which the substrate starts to deform plastically is sensitive to indenter geometry. {\textcopyright} 2009.},

abstract = {In this work, the fretting wear behavior and adhesion of DLC coatings deposited by PACVD on nitrided and non-nitrided martensitic stainless steels were studied. Fretting wear tests were carried out with different duration and loads and pin-on-disk was also performed. The adhesion was evaluated by Rockwell C indentation and scratch test with constant and variable loads. The coating thickness was 2.5. $\mu$m and the nitrided layer, 11. $\mu$m. The coating hardness and Young's Modulus were about 16 and 110. GPa, respectively. The duplex samples resulted with better adhesion than the only coated samples in all test conditions. In the scratch test, the critical load in the duplex sample was 58. N and in the coated sample, 12. N, showing a brittle failure mode. In the Rockwell C indentation test, the adhesion was better in the duplex sample because the nitriding treatment changed the failure mode of the system. The wear resistance was also related to adhesion, since in the experiments with high loads and long durations adhesive failures could be detected when stresses reached the interface and the substrate. In the duplex sample, the nitrided case, with higher load bearing capacity than the substrate, resulted in a better wear behavior of the system.},

The coating is deposited over the internal surface of pipe structured graphite fuel tube, which is a prototype of potential components of compact high-temperature reactor (CHTR). The coating is deposited using atmospheric pressure chemical vapor deposition (APCVD) and properties such as morphology, porosity, thickness variation are evaluated. Micro-structural differences in the coating caused by substrate distance from precursor inlet in a CVD reactor are also studied. The study finds micro-CT a potential tool for characterization of SiC coating during its future course of engineering. We show that depletion of reactants at larger distances causes development of larger pores in the coating, which affects its morphology, density and thickness.},

DLC and CN coatings, due to their novel mechanical and tribological properties, chemical inertness, electrical and optical properties, and biocompatibility, are excellent candidates for biomedical applications. A number of clinical applications for DLC are now being considered by commercial manufacturers of surgical implants. Preliminary studies have shown that DLC coating can be adherent on a range of biomaterials with desirable bulk properties, no toxicity toward living cells, no inflammatory response or loss of cell integrity, as well no cellular damage. Despite only a few reports about biocompatibility of CN coating, which, with its mechanical and chemical properties comparable with DLC, is a very attraction coating material for future biomedical applications. This paper outlines the present level of research and suggests areas for future research, these include in vivo tests and a more detailed investigation of coating bond structure or properties.

abstract = {Molecular-dynamics calculations were performed to simulate ion beam deposition of diamond-like carbon films. Using the computationally efficient analytical potentials of Tersoff and Brenner we are able to simulate more than 103 carbon atom impacts on 111 diamond, so that steady-state film properties can be computed and analyzed. For the Tersoff potential, we achieve sp3 fractions approximately half of the experimentally observed values. For the more refined hydrocarbon potentials of Brenner the fraction of tetrahedrally coordinated atoms is much too low, even if structures with densities close to diamond are obtained. We show, that the sp3 contents calculated with Tersoff's potential are an artifact related to the overbinding of specific bonding configurations between three- and fourfold coordinated sites. On the other hand, we can prove, that the range for the binding orbitals represented by the cutoff function is too short in Brenner's parametrization. If an increased C–C interaction cutoff value is chosen, we achieve a distinct improvement in modeling the sp3 content of deposited ta-C films. As a result we compute sp3 fractions which lie between 52{\%} and 95{\%} for the C ion energies E30–80 eV and are in reasonable agreement with recent experimental studies.},

abstract = {This paper describes an approach to the study of surfaces based on the digital analysis of data obtained from profilometric examinations. This technique is used to determine several new surface texture parameters, including the surface density, height distribution, and mean radius of curvature of the asperities. Recent theories have shown that these are the parameters which control the nature of surface contact. The implications which these ideas have for the science of metrology are discussed. The study also shows that many surfaces have height distributions which are Gaussian, and in particular that the heights of the upper half of most surfaces closely follow a Gaussian distribution. By combining data obtained from many closely spaced parallel profiles it has been possible to reconstruct detailed maps of the surface texture. Two examples are discussed: bead-blasted aluminium, and a glass surface lightly blasted with alumina. One of the advantages of microcartography is that it permits the geometry of the contact between rough surfaces to be studied in detail. A map is given showing the manner in which the contact area between two bead-blasted aluminium surfaces splits into sub-areas, and how these sub-areas are distributed with respect to the surface features of the contacting solids.},

abstract = {In this study diamond like carbon (DLC) coatings with Si interlayers were deposited on 316L stainless steel with varying gas pressure and substrate bias voltage using plasma enhanced chemical vapor deposition (PECVD) technology. Coating and interlayer thickness values were determined using X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) which also revealed the presence of a gradient layer at the coating substrate interface. Coatings were evaluated in terms of the hardness, elastic modulus, wear behavior and adhesion. Deposition rate generally increased with increasing bias voltage and increasing gas pressure. At low working gas pressures, hardness and modulus of elasticity increased with increasing bias voltage. Reduced hardness and modulus of elasticity were observed at higher gas pressures. Increased adhesion was generally observed at lower bias voltages and higher gas pressures. All DLC coatings significantly improved the overall wear resistance of the base material. Lower wear rates were observed for coatings deposited with lower bias voltages. For coatings that showed wear tracks considerably deeper than the coating thickness but without spallation, the wear behavior was largely attributed to deformation of both the coating and substrate with some cracks at the wear track edges. This suggests that coatings deposited under certain conditions can exhibit ultra high flexible properties.},

In order to distinguish unequivocally between films prepared with different density, thickness, and RTA treatment, a new method for analysis of Raman spectra was invented. This newly developed analysis method consisted of plotting the position of the Raman G band of carbon versus its full width at half maximum. Moreover, we studied the passivation of non-radiative recombination centers during RTA by performing measurements of the increase in photoluminescence in conjunction with the analysis of DLC:H networks simulated by molecular dynamics. The results show that dangling bond passivation is primarily a consequence of thermally-induced sp2 clustering rather than hydrogen diffusion in the film.},

abstract = {The theory of rigid perfectly-plastic solids predicts indentation pressures, using wedge-shaped or conical indenters, which depend only on the geometry of the indenter and the yield stress of the material. With blunt wedges or with materials having a low ratio of Young's modulus, E, to yield stress, Y, the material displaced by the indenter is accommodated by an approximately radial expansion of the surrounding material. The indentation pressure then falls below the rigid perfectly-plastic value. In these circumstances, measurements of indentation pressure for a variety of indenter geometries are shown to correlate with the single parameter (E/Y) tan $\beta$, where $\beta$ is the angle of inclination of the indenter to the surface at the edge of the indentation. This parameter may be interpreted as the ratio of the strain imposed by the indenter to the yield strain of the material. A simplified theoretical model of this behaviour is obtained by extending R. Hill's theory of expanding a cylindrical or spherical cavity in an elastic-plastic material to ensure compatibility between the volume of material displaced by the indenter and that accommodated by elastic expansion. {\textcopyright} 1970.},

abstract = {Fretting can be defined as small-amplitude oscillatory motions between two solid surfaces in contact. It has been known for a long time that such loading introduces cracking and/or wear in many structural parts. For very small amplitudes, the contact presents a composite structure where, during the loading cycle, some domains remain stuck whereas others endure sliding. Such a partial slip condition mainly favours crack nucleation and crack propagation. The loading path imposed through the contact requires precise identification of the sliding condition and the local friction coefficient operating through the sliding domain. An energy approach is here developed combining the online identification of the sliding domain and the determination of the local friction coefficient. A normalized fretting sliding chart is introduced and discussed, taking into account the impact of plasticity on the sliding condition. Applying analytical and finite element model computations, it has been shown that crack nucleation under stabilized partial slip can be predicted by transposing multiaxial fatigue criteria (Dang Van, Crossland, McDiarmid and Smith-Watson-Topper). Such a prediction nevertheless requires that the high stress gradient imposed by the contact loading is taken into account. The loading states, which are computed to determine the risk of crack nucleation, must be averaged over an elementary volume whose length scale can be compared with the microstructure.},

Because of their high chemical inertness, they are also resistant to corrosion and oxidation (even at elevated temperatures). The combination of such exceptional qualities in these films makes them ideal for a wide range of demanding tribological applications (such as microelectromechanical systems, cutting tools, mechanical seals, magnetic hard disks, etc.). These films, available for more than three decades, have been used extensively for tooling and magnetic hard disk applications. Their potential in other application areas is currently being explored around the world. With the development of new and more robust deposition methods in recent years, it is envisioned that the production of high quality diamond and DLC films will become very cost effective and highly reliable for large-scale applications ...},

abstract = {Complex mechanical behavior with phase transformation and high brittleness limits the reliability of silicon-based microelectromechanical systems. Although very hard ultra-thin films are being considered as protective overcoats to improve the service life of substrate materials, their resistance to fatigue can be at least as important as hardness when exposed to cyclic loading. In this study repetitive nano-impact tests with a spherical diamond probe have been used to investigate the fatigue behavior and protective role of 5 and 80 nm tetrahedral amorphous carbon (ta-C) films on silicon. At the lowest load there was delamination of the 80 nm film but not for the 5 nm film. At higher loads failure involved lateral cracking of the silicon substrate. Single impact tests showed that this was preceded by ring and radial cracking. Changing contact pressure during the test provided further support for the degradation mechanism and the influence of phase transformation in the Silicon substrate. Under repetitive contact the thin film systems showed lower impact depth and greater impact cycles before substrate fracture than the uncoated Silicon. This is related to their enhanced load support which affects phase transformation in the substrate, with potentially delamination providing an additional impact energy dissipation mechanism.},

abstract = {In present work, we investigated the tribological behavior of the high entropy alloy (HEA) claddings under different degrading environments viz, slurry erosion-corrosion, liquid impingement erosion, electrochemical corrosion, and sliding wear. The HEA claddings were developed by varying Al fraction (AlxCoCrFeNi) (x = 0.1 to 3) using microwave processing. The claddings were composed of cellular structure with intermetallic phases segregated in the intercellular region. Variation in Al content showed significant influence on the microstructure and mechanical properties. The hardness of the claddings increased with an increase in Al fraction with a maximum value of 624 HV observed for the cladding containing three molar Al. Correspondingly, the fracture toughness showed an opposing trend. All claddings showed better wear resistance than SS316L with equimolar composition outperforming other counterparts. The equimolar HEA cladding showed 3 to 23 times higher wear resistance compared to SS316L steel depending upon test conditions. Inimitable wear resilience of the equimolar composition was attributed to its high hardness and strain-hardening ability. Surface morphologies of the tested claddings indicated the presence of ductile-brittle mixed damage modes. The tested surfaces showed numerous pits and cracks with delaminated secondary phase. Presence of groves and signs of delamination were also observed in case of sliding wear. The results of the present work show that microwave synthesized equimolar HEAs can effectively counter different tribological forms.},

abstract = {The friction properties of a range of boundary lubricating additives in diamond-like carbon (DLC)-DLC rolling-sliding contact have been investigated. Two types of commercial DLC have been studied, one hydrogenated diamond-like and the other Cr-doped, non-hydrogenated and graphitic. The graphitic-type DLC coating initially gave very low boundary friction with additive-free base oil but after a few minutes of rubbing in thin film conditions friction rose to a higher value, similar to that produced immediately by the diamond-like carbon. Some organic friction modifiers were able to preserve this low boundary friction behaviour of the graphitic-type DLC for a full 2-h rubbing test. One organic friction modifier, glycerol monooleate produced a considerable reduction in friction with both types of DLC coating in intermediate speed, though noting very slow speed conditions. The additive molybdenum dithiocarbamate formed a low friction film on both DLC surfaces, with lower friction on the graphitic than on diamond-like carbon one. Atomic force microscopy (AFM) measurements showed that this was due to the formation of regions of low lateral force on asperities within the rubbed track. ZDDP provided some reduction in friction on both DLC surfaces after rubbing but did not form thick ZDDP tribofilms like those generated on steel surfaces. ?? 2008 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

It tabulates a comparison of mechanical properties and an indication of industrial use of DLC coatings deposited using plasma-enhanced chemical vapor deposition (PECVD) and physical vapor deposition (PVD) methods. To optimise the performance of DLC coatings operating in demanding contact loading conditions it is useful to assess their mechanical behaviour under more relevant loading conditions than solely in nanoindentation.

The approach combines overload tests with fatigue and durability experiments and it includes a suite of nano-mechanical testing methods, namely nano-indentation, nano-scratch, nano-impact and nano-fretting.},

The specimens were subjected to repetitive percussion impact normal to their surface at 10. Hz (impacts per second) in a ball-on-flat configuration. These tests were carried out using a bespoke, reciprocating hammer type impact wear test-rig. The total number of impacts applied to a particular specimen ranged from 4500 to 72,000. The wear scar produced on each specimen was measured and the nature of any wear features and debris recorded. Selected specimens were further analysed to investigate the microstructural transformation between the cryogenically processed specimens and those that had been left untreated.

abstract = {Fretting wear, defined as a small displacement amplitude oscillatory motion between two solids in contact, is usually induced by vibrations. In the case of surface coatings application it is crucial to establish when the substrate is reached to prevent from catastrophic consequences. Moreover, a reliable selection of surface treatment is of great interest for industrial applications. In this work fretting tests were carried out on different PVD hard coatings (TiN, TiC, TiCN, VC, TiC/VC, (TiC/VC)x2) under wide range of normal loadings and displacement amplitudes. A ball-against-flat specimen arrangement has been analyzed under gross slip fretting regime. The coatings durability criterion based on local dissipated energy has been developed and related to the friction process. The wear depth extension is referred to the cumulated density of friction work dissipated during the test. An averaged cumulated density of dissipated friction energy is successively introduced to rationalize the coating lifetime. The critical dissipated energy density related to the coatings durability has been determined for each analyzed coating and the critical number of fretting cycles has been established. Taking into account this critical value an Energy Density—Coating Endurance chart has been proposed where the coating duration is predicted as a function of the pressure, the displacement amplitude and the friction coefficient. Nevertheless, some divergence has been observed between the predicted and detected surface coating endurance. This has been explained by a coating spalling phenomenon observed below a critical residual coating thickness. Introducing an effective wear coating parameter the coating endurance is better quantified and finally an effective energy density threshold, associated to a friction energy capacity approach, is introduced to rationalize the coating endurance prediction. The investigated hard coatings are compared independently of the loading conditions and its thickness. Finally the global procedure to establish the coatings durability has been presented.},

abstract = {Sand is commonly produced along with production fluids (oil and gas), and this is a major problem for the oil and gas industry. Sand production is a concern, since it can bring about a variety of problems. Amid them, three problems stand out above all: pressure drop, pipe blockage, and erosion. The latter is a complex mechanical process in which material is removed from the pipeline due to repeated sand particle impacts. As a result, the pipeline can be eroded. Eroded pipelines may cause pipe failures which can result in financial losses and environmental issues. Therefore, it is important to know what parameters govern the erosion phenomenon and how it can be modeled. The present work describes key factors influencing erosion and reviews available erosion equations. Furthermore, empirical and mechanistic models for erosion prediction in pipelines are discussed. These models are used by oil and gas companies to limit the maximum production flow rates and avoid excessive erosion damage. Computational fluid dynamics (CFD) based erosion modeling as a comprehensive method for erosion studying is explained as well. Finally, possible limitations and gaps in knowledge concerning erosion are indicated. The current work can be used by oil and gas companies as a comprehensive review of erosion challenges and remedies. Of course, further studies must be undertaken in order to expand the knowledge of erosion and find applicable models for erosion damage prediction and prevention.},

abstract = {Electron energy-loss spectroscopy (EELS) is an analytical technique that is based on inelastic scattering of fast electrons in a thin specimen. In a transmission electron microscope (TEM) it can provide structural and chemical information about a specimen, even down to atomic resolution. This review provides an overview of the physical basis and new developments and applications of EELS in scanning transmission electron microscopy. Recent advances in elemental mapping, spectrum imaging of plasmonic structures and quantitative analysis of atomically resolved elemental maps are highlighted. 1. Introduction The need to understand atomic processes in solids has led to an increasing demand for new imaging, diffraction and spectroscopy methods with high spatial resolution. This need has been reinforced by the growing interest in nanoscience and nanotechnology. Particularly, transmission electron microscopy (TEM) is of unrivalled value, because it can provide structural information with excellent spatial resolution (down to atomic dimensions) via high resolution TEM imaging and electron diffraction. These structural data can be supplemented by chemical information from the same specimen region, obtained using analytical techniques, such as energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDS) and electron energy-loss spectroscopy (EELS) [1]. Due to the broad range of inelastic interactions of the high energy electrons with the specimen atoms, ranging from phonon interactions to ionisation processes, electron energy-loss spectroscopy offers unique possibilities for advanced materials analysis. It can be used to map the elemental composition of a specimen, but also for studying the physical and chemical properties of a wide range of materials and biological matter. Beginning with the increasing use of EEL spectrometers during the eighties of the last century [1], the energy-filtering technique was a major step forward for two-dimensional mapping of the spectral features visible in an EEL spectrum [2, 3]. The wide distribution of energy-filtering TEMs (EFTEM) led to numerous practical applications both in the materials and biological sciences [4]. In the meanwhile, EFTEM is a widely used method for both overview and nanoscale characterisation of thin samples, applicable to most chemical elements and especially sensitive to light elements. With the introduction of high brightness electron sources and spherical aberration correctors, the image resolution of the TEM reaches now the 50 picometre level [5]. Especially scanning transmission electron microscopy (STEM) equipped with a Cs-probe corrector is extremely useful for high resolution imaging [6] and the parallel chemical analysis by EELS and EDS because of the much increased probe current in the corrected beam.},

abstract = {Contact damage modes in cyclic loading with spheres are investigated in three nominally brittle ceramics, soda-lime glass, porcelain and fine-grain silicon nitride, in moist environments. Initial damage at small numbers of cycles and low loads consists of tensile-driven macroscopic cone cracks (`brittle' mode). Secondary damage at large numbers of cycles and high loads consists of shear-driven distributed micro-damage (`quasi-plastic' mode), with attendant radial cracks and a new form of deeply penetrating subsidiary cone cracks. Strength tests on indented specimens are used to quantify the degree of damage. Both damage modes degrade the strength: the first, immediately after cone crack initiation, relatively slowly; the second, after development of radial cracks, much more rapidly. A fracture mechanics model describing the first mode, based on time-integration of slow growth of cone cracks, is presented. This model provides simple power-law relations for the remaining strength in terms of number of cycles and contact load for materials design. Extrapolations of these relations into the quasi-plastic region are shown to be non-conservative, highlighting the need for further understanding of the deleterious quasi-plastic mode in tougher ceramics. Comparison with static contact data indicates a strong mechanical (as opposed to chemical) component in the cyclic fatigue in the quasi-plastic region.},

abstract = {Thin films and multilayers comprised of different classes of material are often used for various functional requirements. As these become relatively large in section and geometrically more complex, thermomechanical integrity is a major concern. It influences performance, yield and reliability. A methodology for thermomechanical design is needed that complements procedures used for circuit design. This article elaborates the principles of fail-safe thermomechanical design, based on the damage mechanisms known to occur in these systems. Among the important mechanisms are delamination and crazing of brittle layers. thermomechanical fatigue of metallic constituents and interface decohesion. The damage mechanisms are generally activated by residual stress, both thermal and 'intrinsic'. The origins of these stresses are discussed, as well as stress redistribution effects that arise because of bending, discontinuities, etc. Emphasis is given to measurement methods which provide those data needed for implementation of the fail-safe design methodology. {\textcopyright} 1995 Acta Metallurgica Inc.},

abstract = {Mycotoxins are small (MW approximately 700), toxic chemical products formed as secondary metabolites by a few fungal species that readily colonise crops and contaminate them with toxins in the field or after harvest. Ochratoxins and Aflatoxins are mycotoxins of major significance and hence there has been significant research on broad range of analytical and detection techniques that could be useful and practical. Due to the variety of structures of these toxins, it is impossible to use one standard technique for analysis and/or detection. Practical requirements for high-sensitivity analysis and the need for a specialist laboratory setting create challenges for routine analysis. Several existing analytical techniques, which offer flexible and broad-based methods of analysis and in some cases detection, have been discussed in this manuscript. There are a number of methods used, of which many are lab-based, but to our knowledge there seems to be no single technique that stands out above the rest, although analytical liquid chromatography, commonly linked with mass spectroscopy is likely to be popular. This review manuscript discusses (a) sample pre-treatment methods such as liquid-liquid extraction (LLE), supercritical fluid extraction (SFE), solid phase extraction (SPE), (b) separation methods such as (TLC), high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC), gas chromatography (GC), and capillary electrophoresis (CE) and (c) others such as ELISA. Further currents trends, advantages and disadvantages and future prospects of these methods have been discussed.},

Twenty-nine healthy and hookworm-free male volunteers were exposed on the forearm to approximately 45 8-day-old N. americanus larvae. All subjects developed discrete maculopapular eruptions at the site of larval application. Following a random double-blind study design, each subject received at the end of the 6th post-infection day either the investigational drug or a placebo as follows: Group I (n = 8)-placebo; Group II (n = 11)-400 mg albendazole with a meal; Group III (n = 10)-400 mg albendazole 3 or more hours after or before a meal. On day 56 post-infection, the stools of all subjects who received placebo were positive for N. americanus eggs (by zinc sulfate flotation technique), compared with 48{\%} positivity (10/21) in those who received albendazole (P = 0.01). By day 63 post-infection, an additional three subjects in the treatment group became positive, for an overall 62{\%} rate of positivity (13/21), i.e., albendazole prevented patent infection in 38{\%}. Administration of albendazole with a meal did not alter drug efficacy. In those subjects in whom patent infections were not prevented, egg output was one-fourth that of the placebo group. There was no difference in viability of eggs appearing in feces of treated and untreated subjects as judged by larval development in Harada-Mori cultures. Our data indicate that albendazole is active against pre-intestinal stages of N. americanus in human infections.},

The excellent tribological behaviour of some non-ferrous coatings also reduces dependence on some harmful components of lubricants. In this work, hydrogenated diamond like carbon (HDLC) and chromium nitride (CrN) coatings sliding against cast iron counterbody have been used to study the interaction with friction modifiers (Moly dimer and Moly trimer) and antiwear additive zinc dialkyldithiophosphate (ZDDP) under boundary lubrication condition. The tribological results of the non-ferrous coatings are compared with those of uncoated steel. Tribofilms are formed using a reciprocating pin-on-plate tribometer. The chemical analysis of the tribofilms has been accomplished using X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS). The XPS analysis shows that the friction modifiers form a low friction tribofilm on the non-ferrous coatings. No antiwear tribofilm derived from ZDDP was observed on the HDLC coating but a stable antiwear tribofilm was found on the CrN coating. Moly dimer together with ZDDP+Base Oil showed the lowest friction coefficient for the CrN coating while Moly trimer along with ZDDP+Base Oil gave the lowest friction for the HDLC coating. This study will investigate the generic differences between the tribofilms formed on the DLC and CrN coatings by two additive-containing oils. {\textcopyright} 2007 Elsevier Ltd.

abstract = {Currently, the application of diamond-like carbon (DLC) coatings for automotive components is becoming a favorable strategy to cope with the new challenges faced by the automotive industry. DLC coatings can effectively lower the coefficient of friction (CoF) and wear rate of engine components, consequently improving the fuel efficiency and durability of these components. Commercially available fully formulated lubricating oils enhance the lubrication of ferrous materials. Therefore, the interaction between nonferrous coatings (e.g., DLC) and commercial lubricating oil must be investigated. A ball-on-plate tribotester was used to run the experiments using stainless steel plates coated with amorphous hydrogenated DLC (a-C:H) and tetrahedral DLC (ta-C) sliding against a 440C stainless steel ball. Wear track was investigated by scanning electron microscopy and atomic force microscopy. Energy dispersive spectroscopy and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy were used to analyze the tribofilms inside the wear track. Raman analysis was performed to investigate the structural change of the coatings. At high temperatures, the CoF decreases but the wear rate increases in the a-C:H and ta-C DLC-coated plates. CoF and wear rate (coated layer and counter surface) are mostly influenced by coating graphitization. Tribochemical films, such as polyphosphate glass, are formed in ta-C and act as protective layers. Therefore, the wear rate of ta-C DLC is lower than that of a-C:H DLC. {\textcopyright} 2014 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract = {Diamond-Like Carbon (DLC) coatings are well known for offering excellent tribological properties. They have been shown to offer low friction and outstanding wear performance in both dry and lubricated conditions. Application of these coatings for automotive components is considered as a promising strategy to cope with the emerging requirements regarding fuel economy and durability. Commercially available oils are generally optimised to work on conventional ferrous surfaces and are not necessarily effective in lubricating non-ferrous surfaces. Recently, the adverse effect of the Molybdenum DialkyldithioCarbamate (MoDTC) friction modifier additive on the wear performance of the hydrogenated DLC has been reported. However, the mechanisms by which MoDTC imposes this high wear to DLC are not yet well understood. A better understanding of DLC wear may potentially lead to better compatibility between DLC surfaces and current additive technology being achieved. In this work, the wear properties of DLC coatings in the DLC/cast iron (CI) system under boundary lubrication conditions have been investigated to try to understand what appears to be a tribocorrosion-type process. A pin-on-plate tribotester was used to run the experiments using High Speed Steel (HSS) plates coated with 15 at.{\{}{\%}{\}} hydrogenated DLC (a-C:15H) sliding against CI pins or ceramic balls. The lubricants used in this study are typical examples of the same fully formulated oil with and without ZDDP. The friction and wear responses of the fully formulated oils are discussed in detail. Furthermore, Optical Microscopy (OM) and Scanning Electron Microscopy (SEM), Energy-Dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDX), Focused Ion Beam (FIB) and Transmission Electron Microscopy (TEM) were used to observe the wear scar and propose wear mechanisms. The X-ray Photoelectron Spectroscopy (XPS) analysis was performed on the tribofilms to understand the tribochemical interactions between oil additives and the DLC coating. Nano-indentation analysis was conducted to assess potential structural modifications of the DLC coating. Coating hardness data could provide a better insight into the wear mode and failure mechanism of such hard coatings. Given the obtained results, the wear behaviour of the hydrogenated DLC coating was found to depend not only on the presence of ZDDP in the oil formulation but also on the counterpart type. This study revealed that the steel counterpart is a critical component of the tribocouple leading to MoDTC-induced wear of the hydrogenated DLC.},

abstract = {We have demonstrated that multi-wavelength Raman and photoluminescence spectroscopies are sufficient to completely characterize the structural properties of ultra-thin hydrogenated diamond-like carbon (DLC:H) films subjected to rapid thermal annealing (RTA, 1 s up to 659 °C) and to resolve the structural differences between films grown by plasma-enhanced chemical vapor deposition, facing target sputtering and filtered cathodic vacuum arc with minute variations in values of mass density, hydrogen content, and sp3 fraction. In order to distinguish unequivocally between films prepared with different density, thickness, and RTA treatment, a new method for analysis of Raman spectra was invented. This newly developed analysis method consisted of plotting the position of the Raman G band of carbon versus its full width at half maximum. Moreover, we studied the passivation of non-radiative recombination centers during RTA by performing measurements of the increase in photoluminescence in conjunction with the analysis of DLC:H networks simulated by molecular dynamics. The results show that dangling bond passivation is primarily a consequence of thermally-induced sp2 clustering rather than hydrogen diffusion in the film.},

@article{Topolovec-Miklozic2008,
abstract = {The friction properties of a range of boundary lubricating additives in diamond-like carbon (DLC)-DLC rolling-sliding contact have been investigated. Two types of commercial DLC have been studied, one hydrogenated diamond-like and the other Cr-doped, non-hydrogenated and graphitic. The graphitic-type DLC coating initially gave very low boundary friction with additive-free base oil but after a few minutes of rubbing in thin film conditions friction rose to a higher value, similar to that produced immediately by the diamond-like carbon. Some organic friction modifiers were able to preserve this low boundary friction behaviour of the graphitic-type DLC for a full 2-h rubbing test. One organic friction modifier, glycerol monooleate produced a considerable reduction in friction with both types of DLC coating in intermediate speed, though noting very slow speed conditions. The additive molybdenum dithiocarbamate formed a low friction film on both DLC surfaces, with lower friction on the graphitic than on diamond-like carbon one. Atomic force microscopy (AFM) measurements showed that this was due to the formation of regions of low lateral force on asperities within the rubbed track. ZDDP provided some reduction in friction on both DLC surfaces after rubbing but did not form thick ZDDP tribofilms like those generated on steel surfaces. ?? 2008 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

abstract = {The use of diamond-like carbon (DLC) coatings in engine tribocomponents is increasingly a strategy to improve fuel economy and component durability to simultaneously provide low friction and excellent wear protection. The influence of conventional additives on the tribological performance of various types of DLC coatings is still poorly understood. This paper addresses the friction and wear performance of a non-hydrogenated DLC (a-C) coating as a function of additive chemistry. Tests were performed in a pin-on-plate tribometer under boundary lubrication conditions. Surface analyses were carried out using Atomic Force Microscopy (AFM), Scanning Electron Microscopy (SEM) and X-ray Photoelectron Spectroscopy (XPS). Results showed that the antiwear additive zinc dialkyldithiophosphate (ZDDP) provided excellent wear protection to a-C coating by forming zinc phosphate in the tribofilm. However, when friction modifier Moly Dimer (MD) or Moly Trimer (MT) was added with ZDDP, zinc phosphate was found to be absent, resulting in higher wear than ZDDP alone. Both friction modifiers decomposed and supplied MoS2 to the tribological interfaces. The transfer of the worn coating material, which was a function of the antiwear performance of additives, was shown to have an influence on friction performance. {\textcopyright} 2010 Elsevier B.V.},

@article{Ferrari2002,
abstract = {Raman spectroscopy is a very popular, non-destructive tool for the structural characterisation of carbons. Raman scattering from carbons is always a resonant process, in which those configurations whose band gaps match the excitation energy are preferentially excited. Any mixture of sp3, sp2 and sp1 carbon atoms always has a gap between 0 and 5.5 eV, and this energy range matches that of IR-vis-UV Raman spectrometers. The Raman spectra of carbons do not follow the vibration density of states, but consist of three basic features, the G and D peaks at approximately 1600 and 1350 cm-1 and an extra T peak, for UV excitation, at ???980-1060 cm-1. We propose to rationalise the vast range of experimental data available in literature at any excitation wavelenght by a simple model, which considers the main factors influencing the Raman spectra. The great advantages of multi-wavelenght Raman spectroscopy will be clarified by a series of examples. In particular we show how it can be used to probe the structural changes induced by annealing and by nitrogen introduction. UV Raman spectroscopy also probes heteropolar ?? bonds in a complementary way to infrared spectroscopy. We demonstrate the direct detection of C-H vibrations in hydrogenated DLC samples, Si-H and Si-C vibrations in amorphous silicon and amorphous silicon-carbon alloys and the easier probe of CN sp bonds in amorphous carbon nitrides. ?? 2002 Elsevier Science B.V.
